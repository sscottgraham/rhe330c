"S23","Digital","Sackey","This production course addresses the relationship between rhetoric, digital storytelling, documentary, and environment. The intersection of media and the environment provides a compelling case for rhetorical inquiry and production. Since the early 1970s, scholars in rhetoric studies have examined documentary film from a rhetorical perspective. Maynard’s The Celluloid Curriculum provided space for using film in high school courses. Thomas Hoffer, Richard Nelson, Barry Winters, and Karen Foss applied rhetorical theory to documentary film and in some cases offered insight into how documentary film making might have a place in rhetoric classrooms. More recently, scholars like Alexandra Hidalgo have pushed rhetoric studies to move from a position of analysis to one of production. In Cámara Retórica, Hidalgo asks that we train more of our students in film and video production in order to expand the boundaries of what digital scholarship might look like in our discipline. This course is designed to address this moment in rhetoric studies. The class is built around film screenings and readings designed to examine the multifaceted relationships between nature and culture. This course is intended to help students learn basic skills in environmental documentary filmmaking. Students will develop their analytical skills through watching films and engaging in discussions of contemporary issues in electronic media as they relate to bringing an environmental story to the screen. Students will work in four teams of three students each and each team will create a short video (five to 10 minutes) on an environmental topic suitable for broadcast."
"S23","Digital","Hsu","This class examines storytelling’s influence on cultural and political struggles, focusing on the genre of podcasts. By listening to a range of podcasts, we will explore how different interview, research, and narrative techniques can affect public perception and policies. Students will study rhetorical criticism and narrative craft while developing hands-on experience in producing their own podcasts. Questions driving our activities throughout the semester include: How does storytelling impact cultural expectations, institutional structures, and distributions of precarity and privilege? How have the histories that preceded us shaped our story ecologies—that is, whose stories are readily accessible, and whose are rarely heard? How do we seek out and amplify stories that we find meaningful? To whom are we accountable in our storytelling, and how do we take responsibility for the effects of our words?"
"S23","Digital","Graham","Did you know that Outkast and Wu-Tang Clan use a larger vocabulary in their lyrics than Shakespeare did in his plays? It's true. How do we know this? Because someone actually measured the number of unique words used by different hip hop artists and compared those figures to Shakespearean plays. Hip hop vocabulary is, of course, not the only rhetoric we can measure. Recent studies of Facebook disinformation campaigns and their effects on polarizing the US electorate have found that the actual content overwhelmingly involved feel-good, positive messaging. Most people assumed it was negative, because it was polarizing. But when you actually measure the emotional content of the posts, it turns out that's not true. Do you know that who used the most sophisticated language of any of the candidates in the 2016 presidential campaign? Apparently, it was Ted Cruz. Is that what you would have guessed? Much of our popular understanding of rhetoric, language, and persuasion is based on instinct and intuition. Rhetorical training offers one very good way of honing that intuition to make it better and more sophisticated. Nevertheless, even the best instincts and intuitions can lead us astray, and sometimes you need to check the numbers behind your ideas about rhetoric in the world. Accordingly, this edition of RHE 330C will provide students with hands-on experience measuring language according to different theories and approaches. This means figuring out what to measure, how to measure it, and then actually measuring it. But, how do you measure the entire collected works of the Wu-Tang Clan and compare it to Shakespeare? Ain't nobody got time for that. You're going to need some help. You're going to need something that can read a whole lot faster than you can. So, in this course, students will teach computers to read. In so doing, students will explore how to use, create, and analyze computational technologies that assess 1) the complexity and difficulty of persuasive texts, 2) the emotional content of bodies of discourse, and 3) the content itself of persuasive language. No prior experience is required to complete this course."
"S23","History","Rhodes","This course explores the rhetoric of liberation in the US in the 1960s, looking in detail at the words and actions of activists in the Civil Rights movement, the anti-war/anti-imperialist movement, Black Power, women’s liberation, gay liberation, the Chicano movement/el movimiento, and other noteworthy phenomena of the era. We will focus in particular on two central questions: (1) How have different groups mobilized liberation rhetoric to demand bodily autonomy and self-determination? and (2) How have different movements “cross-pollinated” in terms of rhetorical strategies? In the acts of exploring and answering these questions, we will speculate on the value of the seismic rhetorical shift of the 1960s to today’s activists, whether liberal, radical, or conservative."
"S23","History","Longaker","Political conservatism in the United States today includes: libertarians like Rand Paul; Christian Evangelicals and Franklin Graham; and country-club Republicans like John Cornyn. What unites all of these people? What ideas do they share? How do they defend these ideas in public debate? This class will investigate the long history of political conservatism with special attention to present-day voices. We will try to find a common intellectual thread between classical thinkers like Edmund Burke and contemporary voices like Murray Rothbard. We will interrogate the scope of conservative argumentation to see, among other things: if feminists can appeal to conservative principles; if present appeals to states rights can be separated from past defenses of U.S. slavery; if emotional appeals to character, virtue, and institutions can convince people to trust themselves more than their government. We will pay special attention to American conservatism beginning with John C. Calhoun and extending to Phyllis Schafly. Students will analyze conservative arguments, will compose arguments based on conservative principles, and will apply these principles to present-day events."
"S23","History","Izaguirre","This course examines the role of sophists and sophistry in the development and practice of rhetoric as an art, from antiquity to modern times."
"S23","Theory","Charney","Strategies for persuading audiences were distilled into the art of rhetoric in ancient Athens, where critical thinking and civic oratory became key parts of democratic governance. This course employs the concepts of rhetorical theory to examine the distinctive persuasive strategies used around the same time in the cultures of the ancient Near East and in the Hebrew Bible in particular. Like other ancient Near Eastern texts, the Hebrew Bible contains many examples of human speakers trying to persuade God or trying to persuade other people on God's behalf. What seems distinctive about the Hebrew Bible is the willingness of Israelites to argue with and challenge God. The assumption that God is open to argument raises fascinating questions: how can one pull off rhetorical tactics with a divine being who is all-powerful and all-knowing? Why should God engage in arguments with humans? How did Israelites discern God's response? The course is structured around three types of discourses: face-to-face interaction, prayer, and prophecy. Students will analyze the rhetorical strategies of Biblical passages of each type, consider how these discourses differed across cultures in the ancient Near East, and relate them to versions of these discourses in the U.S. today."
"S23","Theory","Davis","Aristotle held that there were three basic appeals by which to persuade an audience: appeals to reason (logos), to the speaker’s character (ethos), and to the audience’s emotions (pathos). In contemporary western society, however, the latter is often considered to be a bit unsavory, a slimy way to move an audience to action or attitude—appeals to fear, anger, pity, or shame, it is presumed, line up on the side of seduction and ruse rather than on the side of reason and truth. This prejudice enjoys a long and proud history that is associated with the classical definition of man as a rational animal (animale rationale). The capacity for reason is considered by many to be unique to human animals; indeed, it is considered the means by which humans transcend their animality. Emotional appeals, which shoot for the less lofty realms of sensual reaction, are therefore considered superficial and dangerous, manipulative tactics that lead audiences away from a more objective truth. But Aristotle situated the pathé (the passions or emotions) within the realm of reason, considering them crucial not only to sound judgment but to thinking itself. And contemporary thought in such diverse disciplines as rhetoric, philosophy, neuroscience, and affect theory backs Aristotle on this one: all suggest that emotions fundamentally orient one’s existence in the world, and that there is no disinterested or dispassionate reason—indeed, that thinking itself depends upon the passions. In this course, we will follow Aristotle’s lead and study the ways in which thinking and judgment are intricately tied up with passion. We will read a broad spectrum of texts on emotional life in order to better understand both how we, as people, are moved to action or attitude through our affective engagement, and how we, as rhetors, might use that understanding to craft successful appeals."
"S23","Theory","Diab","Very often we invoke peace as a desirable state of being and of the world. But, what is peace? What does it take to be peaceful? To what extent does our criticism of violence help us get closer to peace? What does peace have to do with rhetoric? We will use these questions to begin our explorations of the rhetoric of peacemaking. The discipline of rhetoric has an enduring investment in countering injustice and pursuing justice and peace. In this course, we will explore this enduring investment. In specific terms, we will study the (1) relation between rhetoric, violence, and peacemaking, (2) ways in which our rhetorical practices can cause/exacerbate conflict or guide us to peacemaking, and (3) rhetorical choices, practices and stances that are consistent with developing peaceful communication styles. As we reflect on the rhetoric of peacemaking, we will read scholarship on the rhetoric of nonviolence, reconciliation, and (human) rights. We will also read/read about illustrative speeches, texts, and rhetorical practices that critique injustice and advocate for justice and peace."
"S23","Theory","Hill","This course explores the rhetorical dimensions and tensions between feminist and scientific analysis, paying close attention to questions of scientific inquiry, interventions, and ethics. We will approach science as a socially-situated practice and scientific knowledge as a political discourse, rather than simply as the neutral presentation of “facts.” To that end, we will investigate social categories, such as sex and race, which are often presented as natural and fixed, to see how they are produced through science. We will also study how these categories shape the production of science itself. We shall engage in this study of U.S. science and society by reading works in Feminist Science Studies and texts from the diverse fields of Biology, Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Rhetoric."
"F22","Digital","Sackey","This course covers fundamental principles of document and information design. Over the course of the semester students will learn practical and theoretical skills related to desktop publishing, visual communication, and publication production. Using industry-standard software applications, you will learn to create, from scratch, visually attractive and functional documents that are used in corporate and non-profit environments. By the end of the course, you can expect to understand: (1) How culturally-specific design principles affect readability, functionality, interpretation, and communication of information; (2) How software applications from the Adobe Creative Suite, including Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator work together; (3) How to create professional-quality, user-centered designs, including logos, brochures, pamphlets, and infographics; and (4)How to use design and technology terminology to communicate effectively with design professionals. No prior design experience is required. This will be a project-based workshop that emphasizes project management and collaboration."
"F22","Digital","Graham","Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeate our daily lives. This includes search engine recommendations, video games, credit scoring, social media feeds, medical technologies, university admissions decisions, police deployment, military applications, self-driving cars, and so on. AI technologies are sold as cost effective and non-biased solutions designed to address many social, economic, and technical problems. However, there is substantial evidence that ill-considered AI development can accelerate inequity and cause all manner of harms. This class is devoted to exploring the nature of AI, its current and possible roles in society, and the rhetoric about it. Along the way, we will explore a range of technologies in various sectors and specific cases where technology has gone awry. Through participating in course activities, students will examine the implications of communication using algorithmic technologies, explore the creative and persuasive potentials of algorithmic technologies, and study the rhetoric of these emerging technologies. Students will also have the opportunity to work directly with algorithmic technologies as a part of in-class activities and several major assignments. No prior experience with technology is required."
"F22","Digital","Spinuzzi","Writing was invented around 3200 BCE as an accounting system. Today, it’s much more than that: it’s a basic skill that we constantly use—among other things, to guide our own actions (think of calendars and to-do lists). That function of self-guidance is called mediation, and it allows us to do things we couldn’t do otherwise. That is, we can give ourselves new capabilities through text mediation, fine-tuning our texts so we can see problems in new ways, coordinate our efforts more effectively, and manage our time successfully. In this class, we’ll learn where writing came from; we’ll examine how text mediation works; and we’ll examine our current systems of text mediation. We’ll learn basic principles of using mediation to manage our time, and we’ll try out new ways to represent relationships between abstractions (such as time and categories) so we can get a better handle on them. We’ll get a better understanding of how text mediation works at individual, team, and organizational levels. Finally, we’ll develop new representations and combinations to help us manage our time and our lives more effectively. This class will draw on insights from writing studies, psychology and neuropsychology, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, and elsewhere."
"F22","History","Longaker","For centuries, Marcus Tullius Cicero’s name has been synonymous with rhetoric and associated with the Roman Revolution. In this class, we will study Cicero’s practice of rhetoric, his theory of oratory, and his efforts at persuasion. Additionally, we will examine Cicero’s political circumstances in order to see what role he played in two well-documented events: the Catilinarian conspiracy and fallout of Julius Caesar’s assassination. Finally, we will apply Cicero’s ideas and his theories of oratory to contemporary public address. Did Cicero contribute to or valiantly fight against the demise of the Roman republic? Was he an honorable statesman or a conservative demagogue? Did Cicero appeal to classical democracy and virtue, or did he pander to Roman prejudices and fears? These questions can only be answered if we learn about his oratory and his circumstances. Additionally, we will ask if present-day politicians and public speakers embody the noble oratory that Cicero (arguably) defended. Or do they continue to practice the cheap asides and the tawdry innuendos that excite the crowd but degrade our culture? If Cicero offered us an ideal of virtuous public discourse, can we improve our own rancorous political climate by taking some of his advice? If Cicero’s rhetoric was not noble, will our own practice of classical rhetorical tricks lead to the collapse of American democracy as it may have contributed to the fall of the Roman republic?"
"F22","History","Charney","What are the founding documents that undergird activism for social justice? A partial list might include the U.S. Constitution, the Bible, and texts from ancient Athens like Aristotle's Rhetoric or Plato's dialogues. Each item has claims to moral authority and provides different kinds of materials that can guide activist rhetoric, such as moral and legal principles, exemplary stories and personages, effective behaviors and strategies. But among scholars, politicians, and activists today, these sources would each provoke heated controversy. For some, religious sources should be excluded as unscientific and as carrying along too much exclusionary sectarian baggage. These might trace the liberties and rights of the U.S. Constitution along a path of Western intellectual history that includes Greek texts. Others would like to trace the Western democratic heritage to a ""Judeo-Christian"" source in which the Hebrew Bible is relevant only as a precursor to the New Testament. However, in many cases, Jewish perspectives don't match those of Christians. In the Hebrew Bible, God time and again calls the Israelites ""an obstinate and stiff-necked people."" And over the centuries, Jews say back, ""No shit, God. You'd better get on your game!"" Finally, some who base the Jewish quest for social justice in the Hebrew Bible have rejected Greek philosophy and rhetoric as antithetical to Jewish intellectual and religious traditions. However, there is considerable evidence of inter-cultural influence in the ancient Near East. The full controversy is far too big for one course to cover. This course has three smaller goals: 1.trace back the Jewish commitment to social justice through the history of argument in the Hebrew Bible and the Talmudic tradition 2.examine how contemporary arguments for social justice draw from alternative founding philosophies 3.consider the possibilities for coalition among groups seeking social justice, in particular where the impetus coasts along and where it encounters friction due to differences among the motivating sources"
"F22","History","Ferreira-Buckley","This course examines women’s rhetorical traditions in 19th and early 20th century America. We will focus on the diverse ways that rhetoric was studied and practiced. Our aim will not be to map out a comprehensive history but rather to investigate the range of rhetorical sites: debating societies, literary circles and salons, speaking societies, libraries, writing groups, letter writing manuals, and classrooms. We will always consider how these grew out of particular social, cultural, and historical contexts to meet the needs and desires of African-American and white women. Finally, we will examine and evaluate the bases for the work that historians present. Students will work with the instructor to design and complete a project that investigates a topic of their choice. Sequenced exercises and writing assignments will help participants develop and complete their project."
"F22","Theory","Piekarski","American rhetoric is strongly grounded in argument and persuasion, and infused with judgments of good and bad, right and wrong. This is true not only for public discourse in the media, academic discourse in schools, and professional writing and speaking, it is also true in everyday conversation. We are constantly trying to convince someone of our judgments, or that something or someone is good or bad, right or wrong—a restaurant, a movie, a car, a teacher. Everything is evaluated and every conversation is full of assertions of value. But what if there were a different, equally “real” way to talk about the world and each other that didn’t create antagonistic relationships? What if we believed that each person is capable of waking up to the reality around her, and responding appropriately, without being converted to some position or belief? What kind of language would we use, and how would we use it?"
"F22","Theory","Rhodes","Does writing matter? Do writers matter? John Durham Peters (U of Iowa) says that the “public sphere is not only a topic of scholarship, but a vision of scholarship and what its larger function should be. The public sphere is exciting for intellectuals because it suggests that intellectuals matter.” In this class, we’ll test that vision, learning how the concept of the “public sphere” informs discussions of the generation, negotiation, and control of information, power, and community values. Many people who engage in “writing in the public sphere” see it as a type of writing that can make a difference—that’s why we see so many blogs, zines, muralists, poets, and letters to the editor from people fashioning themselves as “public intellectuals.” This public writing, then, seems to be a crucial point of contact between the abstract (values/theory/belief) and the concrete (political or cultural action). We’ll spend a lot of time at that point of contact—entering into the conversation about public writing as public writers ourselves."
"F22","Theory","Hill","The image of Justice is often represented as a blindfolded woman holding a scale and double-edged sword. How does this figure function rhetorically, and what relation does it have to law? We often hear about the law doing justice, but how is justice done, seen, and understood? And, what happens when we view law as neither blind nor balanced, especially in relation to social differences, such as gender, race, class, ability, and nationality? To address such questions, the course specifically examines the historical and current relationship between women, as gendered subjects, and law, as a man-made system. Drawing on court cases, social movements, legal theory, and history, we analyze representations of justice, claims of democracy, and ongoing tensions within the law. In other words, we study how legal rhetoric and practice constitute both the law and subjects before the law. The course is also designed to enhance reading and writing skills. Reading may seem to be a straightforward activity requiring no special training, but the analytical reading expected in academic contexts is a skill that must be learned and cultivated. Likewise, analytical writing is an advanced skill that requires instruction and exercise. These activities – reading and writing – are interconnected: to write well, you must be able to analyze the substance and structure of arguments. This course develops skills in these two vital academic areas."
