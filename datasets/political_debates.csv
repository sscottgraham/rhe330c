biden_trump_2020,PARTICIPANTS,Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and President Donald Trump (R) 
biden_trump_2020,MODERATOR,Kristen Welker (NBC News) 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start. And we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific"
biden_trump_2020,MODERATOR,"How would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It's all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Can you tell us what companies? 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I don't think it's going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, 'Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.' But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said 'It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.' Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, your response? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, 'Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.' Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it's going to be over soon. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, your reaction? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don't know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can't do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here's — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Can I respond to that? 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"30 seconds please, and then I have a question. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let me talk about — 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Excuse me. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Very quickly. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it's going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,President Trump. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You're xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't — "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,I didn't say either of those things. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,You certainly did. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That's obvious. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,No. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It's his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,You haven't ruled out more shutdowns 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let's talk about schools. President Trump — 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Well, I think we have to respond, if I might. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Please, and then I have a follow up. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it's their immune system. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, your — "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Vice President. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They're all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They're the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, what about — "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, ""a disaster."" You described him and other medical experts as ""idiots."" If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, 'don't wear masks.' He did say, as you know, 'this is not going to be a problem.' I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, 'this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.' When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, 'don't wear masks.' Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here's his exact words: : 'This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.' So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, 'this is a really dangerous thing,' and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, 'sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.' "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Well this is — 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,I'm going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don't tell me about wall street. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Average contribution, $43. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he'd probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow's wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption? "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, your response. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Did your accountant tell you — 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,At some point I want to respond. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You've been saying for four years you're going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, 'I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.' Come on, come on, folks. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He's the only one. Nobody else has made money from China. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let me ask my question to you. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Could I just — one thing. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Very quickly. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That's 100% dishonest. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,I'm going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,OK. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something — "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"What I'd make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said 'we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.' I said, 'we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.' They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we' re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, let's talk about North Korea. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have... "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China — 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Not true. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"— after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,That is not true. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"First of all, China is paying. They're paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Through sanctions? 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,I just gave $28 billion to our farmers. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Taxpayers money. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,It's what? 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Taxpayers money. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"No, the taxpayers. It's called China. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Not true. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they're bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"I wanted to say, I want to tell — "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, let's talk — "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I'm not a typical politician, that's why I got elected. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let's talk about — 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Let's get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, 'oh there's going to be trouble.' I said, 'No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.' And I was right. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, 'Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?' I said, 'Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.' What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, let's move on to American families. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Kristen, they tried to meet with him. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"They tried to meet with him, he wouldn't do it. He didn't like Obama. He didn't like him. He wouldn't do it. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, I've got to give him a chance to respond. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"They tried, he wouldn't do it. And that's okay. You know what, North Korea, we're not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don't understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we're gonna talk about denuclearization, we're not gonna legitimize you, we're gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That's why he wouldn't meet with us. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,And it didn't happen. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let's move on and talk about American families. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, 'Run it as well as you can' -- to my people, great people -- 'Run it as well as you can.' I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We'll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he's already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do? "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"What he's saying, it's ridiculous. It's like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, your response. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- 'We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.' Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, 'Oh, we're gonna have fracking.' And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"No, no, but that's a question -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,We're gonna get to it -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,It's the same thing with socialized medicine. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President, your response. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Kristen, when he says -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Very quickly, then I want to talk about what's happening on Capitol Hill "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he's destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let's see if -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,-- it was impossible -- 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, your response. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, 'If in fact' -- and, social security -- 'If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,He tried to get rid of -- 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I'm going to have to go on to another question -- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"-- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, let's move on to the next question. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, let's move on to the next question. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,May I respond? 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Very quickly. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,401k's are through the roof. 401k -- 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, let's move on. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"-- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,We're gonna move on -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"-- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,But you're the president. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, Mr. Vice President -- "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn't he talking to his Republican friends? "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Let me follow up with you, Vice President "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"If we made a deal, we'd have -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not Democrats to get a deal for the American people? 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, 'Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.' Come on. What's the matter with these -- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,I want -- 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"I do, because I think one of the things we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You've got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that's supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,We are going to move on -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,You said -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Say again? 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case? 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"What I'd really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They're all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true. On immigration "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it's easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We're over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,But how will you reunite these kids with their families? 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, 'Look at these cages, President Trump built them.' And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Do you have a plan to reunite the kids? 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it's not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let me ask you a follow up -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,So let's talk about -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Who built the cages, Joe? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Let's talk about what we're talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let me just -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean -- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,But some of them haven't been reunited -- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages? "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I've made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it's and it's illegal. You say 'Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.' They've been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, your response. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President, what's your response? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That's never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That's how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, there is -- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"It's so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Not true. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, 'Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, President Trump, let's give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"You don't know the law, Joe. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, your response. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,They don't come back. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Check it out. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, let's move on -- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,But we don't have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don't have to worry about it 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, let's move on to the next section -- "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,You have 525 kids not knowing where in God's name they're going to be and lost their parents. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Go ahead. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called ""the talk."" It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, 'Gee, we have to defeat him.' Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It's one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, 'What are you doing after three years?' I said, 'Why do you keep coming back?' 'Because we have no funding'. I said, 'You don't have to come back every year', 'We have to come back', because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, 'I think you need more'. And I said, 'The only bad part about this is I may never see you again', because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, 'The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,' and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, 'not enough people'. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people's sentences. We committed over 1,000 people's sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you-- "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,I am not-- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,We did-- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Well, I'll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Let me ask them some follow-- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Excuse me-- 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Please respond and then we're gonna have follow up questions. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician-- "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Nobody says-- 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue-- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,It's the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, we're talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump--- "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Please, very quickly. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be-- "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,That's exactly what-- That's exactly what-- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Is this where you're going? This is where he's going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia? "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay-- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting 'Pigs in a blanket', talking about police, 'Pigs, Pigs', talking about our police, 'Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon'. I said, 'That's a horrible thing'. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric? 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I'm the least racist person in this room. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he's gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the 'Poor Boys', last time we were on stage here. He said, 'I told him to stand down and stand ready'. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean-- 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,You said you were Abraham Lincoln. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn't say 'I'm Abraham Lincoln'. I said, 'Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community'. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put-- "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Oh, God. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what's happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what's happening out there. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they're uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? 'That's what I'm gonna do when I become president'. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from-- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,You got nothing done 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we're the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"I just ask-- I just ask one question: : why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, 'I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.' You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,We had a Republican Congress. That's the answer. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,OK. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk 'em into it. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is climate change- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Gentlemen, we're running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can't do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President, Biden-- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,And we haven't destroyed our industries. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I'll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"President Trump, your response -- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"They came out and said very strongly, '$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan', that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they're real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It's $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things-- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"I don't know where he comes from. I don't know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It's the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I'm proposing. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It's extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it's very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing-- "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Find me a scientist that says that. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world-- "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,False. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking? "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond-- 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,I have never said I oppose fracking. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,You said it on tape. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,I'll put it on. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he's flat lying. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Would you rule out banning fracking? 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,I have one more question-- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. 'I am against fracking', until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land-- "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nine times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"My response is that those people live on what they call 'Fence Lines'. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there'd be oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"OK, I have one final question-- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry? 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,I would transition from the oil industry. Yes. 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"Oh, transition. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,It is a big statement because I would stop-- 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,Why would you do that? 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal — 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,That's a big statement. 
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I'd stop giving to the oil industry-- I'd stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry? "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,We actually do give it to solar and wind-- 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, we have one final question-- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,That's the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President-- "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Because basically what he's saying is he's going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio? 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. By 2050, totally. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,All right. One final question-- 
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it? 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"No, we're finished with this. We have to move on to our final question. "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"No, I'm going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,But that'll cost you $1 trillion. 
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump.. Imagine this is your Inauguration Day. What will you say in your address to Americans who did not vote for you? You'll each have one minute, starting with you. "
biden_trump_2020,TRUMP,"We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc.. But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas MIT graduates, number one in the class-- everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I'm cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody's taxes. And he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen. Your 401K's will go to hell and it'll be a very, very sad day for this country. "
biden_trump_2020,WELKER,"All right. Vice President Biden, same question to you. What will you say during your inaugural address to Americans who did not vote for you? "
biden_trump_2020,BIDEN,"I will say, 'I'm the American president. I represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me. And I'm going to make sure that you're represented. I'm going to give you hope. We're going to move. We're going to choose science over fiction. We're going to choose hope over fear. We're going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better. We can grow this economy. We can deal with a systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run, and moved, and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. And that's the fact, that's what we're going to do. And I'm going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency. Honor. Respect. Treating people with dignity. Making sure that everyone has an even chance. Now, I'm going to make sure you get that. You haven't been getting it the last four years. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,PARTICIPANTS,"Former Vice President Jospeh Biden; Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg (New York City); Mayor Pete Buttigieg (South Bend, IN); Senator Amy Klobuchar (MN); Senator Bernie Sanders (VT); and Senator Elizabeth Warren (MA); "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,MODERATORS,Vanessa Hauc (Telemundo); Lester Holt (NBC News); Hallie Jackson (NBC News); Jon Ralston (Nevada Independent); and Chuck Todd (NBC News) 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Good evening, everyone. I'm Lester Holt. Welcome to Las Vegas. Everything is on the line tonight, with just three days before the critical Nevada caucuses. Here with me on the stage tonight, NBC News political director and moderator of ""Meet the Press,"" Chuck Todd. And NBC News chief White House correspondent and MSNBC anchor Hallie Jackson. Also joining us is Telemundo senior correspondent Vanessa Hauc. And editor of the Nevada Independent Jon Ralston, who has covered Nevada politics for more than three decades. The rules are this tonight. Candidates will get a minute and 15 seconds to answer each question and 45 seconds for follow-ups. Now that the stage is narrowed to six candidates, we encourage each of you to directly engage with each other on the issues. So let's get to our first question. Since the last time you all shared the stage, Senator Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has surged into the lead nationally in the Democratic race. And there's a new person on the stage tonight, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a former Republican who spent millions of his own dollars to run in this race. What hasn't changed: a majority of Democratic voters still say their top priority is beating President Trump. Senator Sanders, the first question to you. Mayor Bloomberg is pitching himself as a centrist who says he's best positioned to win in November. Why is your revolution a better bet? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"In order to beat Donald Trump, we're going to need the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States. Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop and frisk which went after African-American and Latino people in an outrageous way. That is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout. What our movement is about is bringing working-class people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American, around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class. And that agenda says that maybe, just maybe, we should join the rest of the industrialized world, guarantee health care to all people as a human right, raise that minimum wage to a living wage of $15 bucks an hour, and have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry, because their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet and the need to combat climate change. Those are some of the reasons we have the strongest campaign to defeat Donald Trump. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,So I'd like... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Mayor Bloomberg, can Senator Sanders beat President Trump? And how do you want to respond to what else he said? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"I don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump. You don't start out by saying I've got 160 million people I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love. That's just not a way that you go and start building the coalition that the Sanders camp thinks that they can do. I don't think there's any chance whatsoever. And if he goes and is the candidate, we will have Donald Trump for another four years. And we can't stand that. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,Senator Warren? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"So I'd like to talk about who we're running against, a billionaire who calls women ""fat broads"" and ""horse-faced lesbians."" And, no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist polls like redlining and stop and frisk. Look, I'll support whoever the Democratic nominee is. But understand this: Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. [applause] This country has worked for the rich for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt. It is time to have a president who will be on the side of working families and be willing to get out there and fight for them. That is why I am in this race, and that is how I will beat Donald Trump. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,We've got to wake up... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar, what do you think the path is from this stage to the White House? What works? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"I think the path is a high voter turnout. I'm the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country when I led the ticket, as well as bringing in rural and suburban voters. And I've done that, as well. And I'm the only one with the receipts to have done that in Republican congressional districts over and over again. But I want to say this: I actually welcomed Mayor Bloomberg to the stage. I thought that he shouldn't be hiding behind his TV ads, and so I was all ready for this big day. And then I looked at the memo from his campaign staff this morning, and it said that he actually thought that three of us should get out of the way. That is what his campaign said because we should ""pave the way"" for him to become the nominee. You know, I have been told as a woman, as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage, but I am because of pure grit and because of the people out there, I've been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside. And I'm not going to do that now, and I'm not going to do that because a campaign memo from Mayor Bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him. I think we need something different than Donald Trump. I don't think you look at Donald Trump and say we need someone richer in the White House. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Thank you. Mayor Bloomberg, there's a lot for you to respond to there, so here's your opportunity. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"I think we have two questions to face tonight. One is, who can beat Donald Trump? And, number two, who can do the job if they get into the White House? And I would argue that I am the candidate that can do exactly both of those things. I'm a New Yorker. I know how to take on an arrogant conman like Donald Trump, that comes from New York. I'm a mayor or was a mayor. I know how to run a complicated city, the biggest, most diverse city in this country. I'm a manager. I knew what to do after 9/11 and brought the city back stronger than ever. And I'm a philanthropist who didn't inherit his money but made his money. And I'm spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst president we have ever had. And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Vice President Biden, I'll let you weigh in here. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"In terms of who can beat Donald Trump, NBC did a poll yesterday. It says Joe Biden is best equipped to beat Donald Trump. [applause] That's what your poll said. And it said that I can beat him in those toss-up states, too, those states we have to win. I'm ahead by eight points across the board. So in terms of being able to beat Donald Trump, I'm better positioned, according to your poll, than anybody else to beat Donald Trump, number one. [applause] Number two, the mayor makes an interesting point. The mayor says that he has a great record, that he's done these wonderful things. Well, the fact -- the fact of the matter is, he has not managed his city very, very well when he was there. He didn't get a whole lot done. He had stop and frisk, throwing close to 5 million young black men up against a wall. And when we came along in our administration, President Obama, and said we're going to send in a moderator to -- a mediator, stop it, he said that's unnecessary. So I -- we're going to get a chance to talk about the mayor's record. But in terms of who is best prepared to beat Donald Trump, look at your poll and what it says. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Mayor Buttigieg, you'd like to weigh in. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Yes, we've got to wake up as a party. We could wake up two weeks from today, the day after Super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg, the two most polarizing figures on this stage. And most Americans don't see where they fit if they've got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power. Let's put forward somebody who actually lives and works in a middle-class neighborhood, in an industrial Midwestern city. Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat. Look... [applause] We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out. We can do better. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Senator -- Senator Sanders, are you polarizing? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"If speaking to the needs and the pain of a long-neglected working class is polarizing, I think you got the wrong word. What we are trying finally to do is to give a voice to people who after 45 years of work are not making a nickel more than they did 45 years ago. We are giving a voice to people who are saying we are sick and tired of billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg seeing huge expansions of their wealth while a half-a-million people sleep out on the street tonight. And that's what we are saying, Pete, is maybe it's a time for the working class of this country to have a little bit of power in Washington, rather than your billionaire campaign contributors. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"All right, look, first of all -- look, my campaign is fueled by hundreds of thousands of contributors. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,Including 46 billionaires. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Among the hundreds of thousands of contributors. And, look, we've got to unite this country to deal with these issues. You're not the only one who cares about the working class. Most Americans believe we need to empower workers. [applause] As a matter of fact, you're the one who is at war with the Culinary Union right here in Las Vegas. We can solve these issues... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,We more union support than you have ever dreamed of. We have the support of unions all across this country. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Yeah, but the vision I'm putting forward has the support of the American people. We can actually deliver health care without taking it away from anyone. We can actually empower workers and lift wages without further polarizing this country. And we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking Democratic figures and union leaders alike. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,I think it is important here... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Senator Warren, I have a question for you. On Sunday, on ""Meet the Press,"" Vice President Biden accused Senator Sanders' supporters of bullying union leaders here with, quote, ""vicious, malicious, misogynistic things."" You said Democrats cannot build an inclusive party on a foundation of hate. Are Senator Sanders and his supporters making it harder for Democrats to unify in November? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"Look, I have said many times before, we are all responsible for our supporters. And we need to step up. That's what leadership is all about. But the way we are going to lead this country and beat Donald Trump is going to be with a candidate who has rock-solid values and who actually gets something done. When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African-Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008, I was right here in Las Vegas, literally just a few blocks down the street, holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families. That's when I met Mr. Estrada, one of your neighbors. He came in to testify, and he said he thought he'd done everything right with Wells Fargo, but what had happened? They took away his house in a matter of weeks. This man stood there and cried while he talked about what it was like to tell his two little daughters that they might not be in their elementary school, that they might be living out of their van. I spent the next years making sure that would never happen again. Wall Street fought us every inch of the way on a consumer agency. They lost, and I won. We need a candidate with unshakable values and a candidate who can actually get something done for working people. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Thank you, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"That's why I'm in this race, and that's how I'll beat Donald Trump. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,Senator Sanders? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"We have over 10.6 million people on Twitter, and 99.9 percent of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion, and love. And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement. But let me also say what I hope my friends up here will agree with is that if you look at the wild west of the internet, talk to some of the African-American women on my campaign. Talk to Senator Nina Turner. Talk to others and find the vicious, racist, sexist attacks that are coming their way, as well. So I would hope that all of us understand that we should do everything we possibly can to end the viciousness and ugliness on the internet. Our campaign is about issues. It's about fighting for the working families and the middle class. It is not about vicious attacks on other people. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Senator, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Senator, when you say that you disown these attacks and you didn't personally direct them, I believe you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Well, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"But at a -- but at a certain point, you got to ask yourself, why did this pattern arise? Why is it especially the case among your supporters that this happens? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"I don't think it is especially the case, by the way. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"That's just not true. Look, people know the way your supporters treat them. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Well, Pete, if you want to talk to some of the women on my campaign, what you will see is the most ugly, sexist, racist attacks that are -- I wouldn't even describe them here, they're so disgusting. And let me say something else about this, not being too paranoid. All of us remember 2016, and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up. I'm not saying that's happening, but it would not shock me. I saw some of those tweets regarding the Culinary Workers Union. I have a 30-year 100 percent pro-union voting record. Do you think I would support or anybody who supports me would be attacking union leaders? It's not thinkable. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"But leadership is about what you draw out of people. It's what -- it's about how you inspire people to act. [applause] And right now, we're in this toxic political environment. Leadership isn't just about policy. I think at least in broad terms, we're largely pulling in the same direction on policy, but leadership is also about how you motivate people to treat other people. I think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign in particular that seems to be motivating this behavior more than others, because in order to turn the page on the Trump era, we're going to need a president, not just a candidate who can win, but a president who can move us forward. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"I have an idea -- I have an idea of how we can stop sexism on the internet. We could nominate a woman for candidate for president of the United States. [applause] I think that might go a long way if we showed our stuff as a party. And the other thing I'm going to talk about is really what is at the core of this issue between Senator Sanders and the Culinary Union, and that is this. These are hard-working people, housekeepers like Elizabeth and I met with last night, who have health care plans that have been negotiated over time, sweat and blood. And that is the truth for so many Americans right now. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Senator, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,There are 149 million Americans that would lose their current health insurance under Senator Sanders' bill. That's what it says on page 8. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Senator, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,And I don't think we should forget that. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"On that note, I want to turn it over to my colleague, Chuck Todd. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Senator Sanders, I'm going to stay on this topic, on this issue with the Culinary Union. Obviously, their leaders are warning their members about -- that your health care plan will take away their health care plan, take away private insurance completely. There are some Democrats who like you a lot but worry that this plan, Medicare for all, is going to take away private insurance and that it goes too far. Are they right? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"No. Let me be very clear, two points. For a hundred years, from Teddy Roosevelt to Barack Obama, this country has been talking about the need to guarantee health care for all people. And yet today, despite spending twice as much per capita, Chuck, twice as much as any other major country on Earth, we got 87 million who are uninsured or underinsured, we got over 60,000 people who die every year because they don't get to a doctor on time. We're getting ripped off outrageously by the greed and corruption of a pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same drugs because of their price-fixing, 500,000 people go bankrupt every year because they can't afford medical bills. So let me be very clear to my good friends in the Culinary Workers Union, a great union. I will never sign a bill that will reduce the health care benefits they have. We will only expand it for them, for every union in the America, and for the working class of this country. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Senator Warren, you were all in on Medicare for all, and then you have since came up with a transition plan. Is it because of the impact on unions? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"So I want to be clear. I've been to the Culinary Union's health care facilities. They're terrific. You don't want to shut them down. You want to expand them. You want to see them all across Nevada and all across this country. But we need to get everybody's health care plan out here. Mayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their health care. It's not a plan. It's a PowerPoint. And Amy's plan is even less. It's like a Post-It note, ""Insert Plan Here."" Bernie has started very much -- has a good start, but instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead, his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisors say, yeah, probably won't happen anyway. Look, health care is a crisis in this country. We need -- my approach to this is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible and bring in as many supporters as we can. And if we don't get it all the first time, take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Guys, I'm going to get everybody in. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,People need our help on this. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"I got you. Mayor Buttigieg, I think she name-checked you first. I'll let you go first. [laughter] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,She name-checked me second. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Yes, well, OK. I think Amy second. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"I'm more of a Microsoft Word guy. And if you look at my plan, I don't know if there are any PowerPoints on it, but you can definitely find the document on peteforamerica.com. And you'll see that it is a plan that solves the problem, makes sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American, and does it without kicking anybody off the plan that they have. This idea that the union members don't know what's good for them is the exact kind of condescension and arrogance that makes people skeptical of the policies we've been putting forward. Here we have a plan that the majority of Americans support. Do you realize how historic that is? That the American people are ready in a way far beyond what was true even 10 years ago and what was available to President Obama at the time. There's a powerful American majority ready to undertake the biggest, most progressive reform we've had in health care in 50 years, just so long as we don't force it on anybody. What is wrong with that? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,Could I respond to that? [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Let me go Senator Klobuchar, and then I'll have you respond. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,OK. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"All right, Senator Klobuchar. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,I was [inaudible] through there. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Well, I think the Post-It note came first, Senator. I don't know. [crosstalk] I do think the Post-It note came first. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"I must say, I take personal offense since Post-It notes were invented in my state, so...[laughter] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,[inaudible] 3M. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"OK. So my plan is a public option. And according to all the studies out there, it would reduce premiums for 12 million people immediately. It would expand coverage for about that same number. It is a significant thing. It is what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning. And the way I look at it, since we're in Vegas, when it comes to your plan, Elizabeth and Bernie's, on Medicare for all, you don't put your money on a number that's not even on the wheel. And why is Medicare for all not on the wheel? Why is it not on the wheel? Because two-thirds of the Democratic senators are not even on that bill, because a bunch of the new House members that got elected see the problems with blowing up the Affordable Care Act. They see it right in front of them. And the truth is that when you see some troubled waters, you don't blow up a bridge, you build one. And so we need to improve the Affordable Care Act, not blow it up. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,You name-checked three of them. Let me get Senator Sanders in there. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,I'm also attacked here. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Go ahead, Senator Sanders. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,We'll get you in. We got a lot of people in here. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Some -- it's my turn, yeah? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Yes, sir. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Somehow or another, Canada can provide universal health care to all their people at half the cost. U.K. can do it. France can do it. Germany can do it. All of Europe can do it. Gee-whiz, somehow or another, we are the only major country on Earth that can't do it. Why is that? And I'll tell you why. It's because, last year, the health care industry made $100 billion in profits. Pharmaceutical industry, top six companies, $69 billion in profit. And those CEOs are contributing to Pete's campaign and other campaigns up here. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,Let's clear this up right now. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"So maybe it is finally time that we said as a nation, enough is enough, the function of a rational health care system is not to make the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies rich. It is to provide health care to all people as a human right, not a privilege. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Mr. Vice President, you got it. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"No premiums, no copayments, no deductibles. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Mr. Vice President, go ahead, and then Senator Warren. [crosstalk] Mr. Vice President and Senator Warren. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Hey, I'm the only one on this stage that actually got anything done on health care, OK? [applause] I'm the guy the president turned to and said, go get the votes for Obamacare. And I notice what everybody's talking about is the plan that I first introduced. That is to go and add to Obamacare, provide a public option, a Medicare-like option. It cost -- and increase the subsidies. It cost a lot of money. It cost $750 billion over 10 years. But I paid for it by making sure that Mike and other people pay at the same tax rate their secretary pays at. [applause] That's how we get it paid, number one. Number two, you know, from the moment -- from the moment we passed that signature legislation, Mike called it a disgrace, number one. Number two, Trump decided to get rid of it. And, number three, my friends here came up with another plan. But they don't tell you, when you ask Bernie how much it costs, the last time he said that -- I think it was on your show -- he said we'll find out, we'll find out or something to that effect. It cost over $35 trillion bucks. Let's get real. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Senator Warren, you get the final word on this one and then we go to another question. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,And your plan costs $50 trillion. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Go ahead, Senator Warren. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"What am I, chicken liver? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"So I actually took a look at the plans that are posted. Mayor Buttigieg, there are four expenses that families pay, right, premiums, deductibles, co-pays, and uncovered medical expenses. Mayor Buttigieg says he will put a cap only on the premiums. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,It's not true. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"And that means families are going to pick up the rest of the costs. Amy, I looked online at your plan. It's two paragraphs. Families are suffering, and they need... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"OK, that's it. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"You can't simply stand here and trash an idea to give health care coverage to everyone without having a realistic plan of your own. And if you're not going to own up to the fact either that you don't have a plan or that your plan is going to leave people without health care coverage, full coverage, then you need to say so. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"I just want to say on this one, I was in Reno when I met a man who said he had diabetes. He gets his insulin through the V.A. But his sister and his daughter also have diabetes, no way to pay for their insulin. Three human beings right here in Nevada who are struggling. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,My plan takes care of that. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,They share one insulin prescription. That should not happen in America. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Mayor Bloomberg, is Vice President Biden right, you weren't a fan of Obamacare? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,I am a fan of Obamacare. At the beginning... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Since when, Mr. Mayor? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Mr. Vice President, I just checked the record, because you'd said one time that I was not. In '09, I testified and gave a speech before the mayors' conference in Washington advocating it and trying to get all the mayors to sign on. And I think at that time I wrote an article praising Obamacare. It was either in the New York Post or the Daily News. So the facts are I was there. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Didn't you call it a disgrace, though, Mr. Mayor? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Let me finish, thank you. I was in favor of it. I thought it didn't do -- go as far as we should. What Trump has done to this is a disgrace. The first thing we've got to do is get the White House and bring back those things that were left and then find a way to expand it, another public option, to having some rules about capping charges. All of those things. We shouldn't just walk away and start something that is totally new, untried. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"OK, Vice President Biden, go ahead. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"The mayor said, when we passed it, the signature piece of this administration, it's a disgrace. They're the exact words, it was a disgrace. Look it up, check it out. ""It was a disgrace."" And I covered, by the way, my plan, you do not have surprise billing, you bring down drug prices, people are not -- and give people all the things we were just talking about. I guess we've not got the time to do it, but I'll get a chance to talk about... [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Thank you, sir. Lester? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,All right. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Mayor Bloomberg, at the beginning of this debate, you took some incoming fire on this next topic, so let's get into it. In 2015, this is how you described your policing policy as mayor. Quote, ""We put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods."" And you explained that as, quote, ""Because that's where all the crime is."" You went on to say, ""And the way you should get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them."" You've apologized for that policy. But what does that kind of language say about how you view people of color or people in minority neighborhoods? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Well, if I go back and look at my time in office, the one thing that I'm really worried about, embarrassed about, was how it turned out with stop and frisk. When I got into office, there were 650 murders a year in New York City. And I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live. That's the basic right of everything. And we started -- we adopted a policy, which had been in place, the policy that all big police departments use, of stop and frisk. What happened, however, was it got out of control. And when we discovered -- I discovered that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95 percent of it out. And I've sat down with a bunch of African-American clergy and businesspeople to talk about this, to try to learn. I've talked to a number of kids who'd been stopped. And I'm trying -- was trying to understand how we change our policy so we can keep the city safe, because the crime rate did go from 650, 50 percent down to 300. And we have to keep a lid on crime. But we cannot go out and stop people indiscriminately. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"All right, Mayor... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,And that was what was happening. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Let me go to Vice President Biden on this. You want to respond to that, react to it? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Yes, let's get something straight. The reason that stop and frisk changed is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on. When we sent them there to say this practice has to stop, the mayor thought it was a terrible idea we send them there, a terrible idea. Let's get the facts straight. Let's get the order straight. And it's not whether he apologized or not. It's the policy. The policy was abhorrent. And it was a fact of violation of every right people have. [applause] And we are the one, my -- our administration sent -- sent in people to moderate. And at the very time, the mayor argued against that. This idea that he figured out it was a bad idea, he figured out it was a bad idea after we sent in monitors and said it must stop. Even then, he continued the policy. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"All right. Mayor, would you like to make a quick response to that? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Yes, I would. I've sat, I've apologized, I've asked for forgiveness, but the bottom line is that we stopped too many people, but the policy -- we stopped too many people. And we've got to make sure that we do something about criminal justice in this country. There is no great answer to a lot of these problems. And if we took off everybody that was wrong off this panel, everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers, there'd be nobody else up here. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,Senator Warren? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,So I... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Let's be clear -- I'm sorry, who did you call on? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,Senator Warren. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,Sorry. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"I think this -- he called me. I do think that this really is about leadership and accountability. When the mayor says that he apologized, listen very closely to the apology. The language he used is about stop and frisk. It's about how it turned out. No, this isn't about how it turned out. This is about what it was designed to do to begin with. [applause] It targeted communities of color. It targeted black and brown men from the beginning. And if you want to issue a real apology, then the apology has to start with the intent of the plan as it was put together and the willful ignorance, day by day by day, of admitting what was happening even as people protested in your own street, shutting out the sounds of people telling you how your own policy was breaking their lives. You need a different apology here, Mr. Mayor. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Senator, thank you. Chuck? [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Let me get Senator Klobuchar. We're staying on this topic. We're going to stay on this topic, but I want to get something in here with Senator Klobuchar. When you were the top prosecutor in Minneapolis, Senator, there were at least two dozen instances where police were involved in the deaths of civilians. None of those officers were prosecuted. You did prosecute a black teenager who was sentenced to life in prison, despite what are now serious doubts about the evidence. Now, the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP has recently called for you to suspend your campaign over that case because some new evidence has come out since. Big picture, why should black and Latino voters trust your judgment now if it appears you may have gotten it wrong then? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"First, I'll start with that case. It is very clear that any evidence, if there is new evidence, even old evidence, it should be reviewed by that office and by the county attorney. That must happen. I have called for that review. This was a case involving an 11-year-old African-American girl named Tyesha Edwards who was shot doing her homework at her kitchen table. Three people were convicted. One of the cases is the one that is being investigated, was investigated by a journalist. And I think it's very important that that evidence come forward. In terms of the police shootings that you noted, those went to a grand jury, every single one of them. And I have made very clear for months now that, like so many prosecutors, I think those cases in my time, they were all going to the grand jury. It was thought that was the best way to handle them in many, many jurisdictions. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,Do you think you should have spoke up? You didn't speak up at the time. Should you? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Did -- I actually did speak up on something very similar. And that was when our police chief in Minneapolis tried to take the investigations of police shootings into his own hands. And I strongly said I disagreed with that. Now I do believe also that a prosecutor should make those decisions herself. And the last thing I will say, because you asked the question about voting, I have the support of African-Americans in my community in every election. I had strong support and strong support of leadership. And that's because I earned it. And this is going to be on me to earn it. You earn it with the -- what you stand for when it comes to equal opportunity. You earn it with the work that I have done, the leadership I've shown on voting rights, and, yes, you earn it with the work that must be done on criminal justice reform. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"OK, thank you, Senator. Hallie Jackson? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"I want to talk about transparency here, because many Democrats, including most of you on stage, have criticized President Trump for his lack of transparency. But, Senator Sanders, when you were here in Las Vegas in October, you were hospitalized with a heart attack. Afterwards, you pledged to make, quote, ""all your medical records public."" You've released three letters from your doctors, but you now say you won't release anything more. What happened to your promise of full transparency? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Well, I'll tell you. Well, I think we did. Let me tell you what happened. First of all, you're right. And thank you, Las Vegas, for the excellent medical care I got in the hospital for two days. [applause] And I think the one area maybe that Mayor Bloomberg and I share, you have two stents, as well. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,Twenty-five years ago. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Well, we both have two stents. It's a procedure that is done about a million times a year. So we released the full report of that heart attack. Second of all, we released the full -- my whole 29 years in the Capitol, the attending physician, all of my history, medical history. And furthermore, we released reports from two leading Vermont cardiologists who described my situation and, by the way, who said Bernie Sanders is more than able to deal with the stress and the vigor of being president of the United States. Hey, follow me around the campaign trail, three, four, five events today. See how you're doing compared to me. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Mayor Buttigieg, you've been critical about transparency on this stage and people needing to do better. Is that response from Senator Sanders enough for you? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"No, it's not, because, first of all, let me say, we're all delighted that you are in fighting shape. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,Thank you. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"And at the same time, transparency matters, especially living through the Trump era. Now, under President Obama, the standard was that the president would release full medical records, do a physical, and release the readout. I think that's the standard that we should hold ourselves to, as well. Now, President Trump lowered that standard. He said just a letter from a doctor is enough. And a lot of folks on this stage are now saying that's enough. But I am certainly prepared to get a physical, put out the results. I think everybody here should be willing to do the same. But I'm actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sanders' personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his health care plan, since he's said that it's impossible to even know how much it's going to cost, and even after raising taxes on everybody making $29,000, there is still a multi-trillion-dollar hole. As a matter of fact, if you add up all his policies altogether, they come to $50 trillion. He's only explained $25 trillion worth of revenue, which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States. The time has come to level with the American people on matters personal and on matters of policy. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Thank you. Senator Sanders, quickly. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Let's level. Let's level, Pete. Under your plan, which is a maintenance continuation of the status quo... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,That's untrue. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Can I finish? The average American today is paying $12,000 a year. That's what that family is paying, 20 percent of a $60,000 income, $12,000 a year, highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Just the other day, a major study came out from Yale epidemiologist in Lancet, one of the leading medical publications in the world. What they said, my friends, is Medicare for all will save $450 billion a year, because we are eliminating the absurdity of thousands of separate plans that require hundreds of billions of dollars of administration and, by the way, ending the $100 billion a year in profiteering from the drug companies and the insurance companies. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,This is really important. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Mayor Bloomberg, I want to go to you on this. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Your plan, by the way, will increase costs. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"He said my plan is the status quo, and that's false. Look, if my plan is the status quo, why was it attacked by the insurance industry the moment it came out? And on issue after issue after issue, this is what Senator Sanders is saying. If you're not with him, if you're not all the way on his side, then you must be for the status quo. Well, you know what? That is a picture that leaves most of the American people out. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"I want to go to Mayor Bloomberg on this, the transparency issue. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Very briefly on transparency, Mayor Bloomberg, your campaign has said that you would eventually release your tax records. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,Yes. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"When it comes to transparency, but people are already voting now. Why should Democratic voters have to wait? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,It just takes us a long time. Unfortunately or fortunately... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,Could I comment on that... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Fortunately, I make a lot of money, and we do business all around the world. And we are preparing it. The number of pages will probably be in the thousands of pages. I can't go to TurboTax. But I put out my tax return every year for 12 years in City Hall. We will put out this one. It tells everybody everything they need to know about every investment that I make and where the money goes. And the biggest item is all the money I give away. And we list that, every single donation I make. And you can get that from our foundation any time you want. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,Senator Klobuchar? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"OK, yeah, I'm just looking at my husband in the front row that has to, like, do our taxes all the time. We probably could go to TurboTax. And the point of this is, I believe in transparency. I had a physical, by the way. It came out well. We might all be surprised if my blood pressure is lower than Mayor Pete's. That might really shock everyone out there. And I think you should release your records from your physical. Secondly, when it comes to tax returns, everyone up here has released their tax returns, Mayor. I think -- and it is a major issue, because the president of the United States has been hiding behind his tax returns, even when courts order him to come forward with those tax returns. [applause] And I think -- I don't care how much money anyone has. I think it's great you've got a lot of money. But I think you've got to come forward with your tax returns. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Senator, I want to get to you in a second. Mayor Bloomberg, quick response to Senator Klobuchar? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"We'll releasing them. They'll be out in a few weeks. And that's just as fast as I can do it. Remember, I only entered into this race 10 weeks ago. All of my associates here have been at this for a couple of years. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"That's right, we have. Engaging with voters and humbling ourselves to the backyards and diners. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Let me ask about something else, Mr. Mayor, because, Mayor Bloomberg -- let me ask about something else. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"... 10 weeks ago, pay overtime, and get it done. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,I wish it were that simple. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"I'll let you get in here, but, Mayor Bloomberg... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,It would save me a lot of money. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Let me ask you about something else. Several former employees have claimed that your company was a hostile workplace for women. When you were confronted about it, you admitted making sexually suggestive remarks, saying, quote, ""That's the way I grew up."" In a lawsuit in the 1990s, according to the Washington Post, one former female employee alleged that you said, quote, ""I would do you in a second."" Should Democrats expect better from their nominee? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Let me say a couple of things, if I could have my full minute and a quarter, thank you. I have no tolerance for the kind of behavior that the ""Me, Too"" movement has exposed. And anybody that does anything wrong in our company, we investigate it, and if it's appropriate, they're gone that day. But let me tell you what I do at my company and my foundation and in city government when I was there. In my foundation, the person that runs it's a woman, 70 percent of the people there are women. In my company, lots and lots of women have big responsibilities. They get paid exactly the same as men. And in my -- in City Hall, the person, the top person, my deputy mayor was a woman, and 40 percent of our commissioners were women. I am very proud of the fact that about two weeks ago we were awarded, we were voted the most -- the best place to work, second best place in America. If that doesn't say something about our employees and how happy they are, I don't know what does. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Senator Warren, you've been critical of Mayor Bloomberg on this issue. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"Yes, I have. And I hope you heard what his defense was. ""I've been nice to some women."" That just doesn't cut it. The mayor has to stand on his record. And what we need to know is exactly what's lurking out there. He has gotten some number of women, dozens, who knows, to sign nondisclosure agreements both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace. So, Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements, so we can hear their side of the story? [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,We have a very few nondisclosure agreements. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,How many is that? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,Let me finish. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,How many is that? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"None of them accuse me of doing anything, other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told. And let me just -- and let me -- there's agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet and that's up to them. They signed those agreements, and we'll live with it. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,Come on. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"So, wait, when you say it is up to -- I just want to be clear. Some is how many? And -- and when you -- and when you say they signed them and they wanted them, if they wish now to speak out and tell their side of the story about what it is they allege, that's now OK with you? You're releasing them on television tonight? Is that right? [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,Senator... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"Is that right, tonight? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Senator, the company and somebody else, in this case -- a man or a woman or it could be more than that, they decided when they made an agreement they wanted to keep it quiet for everybody's interests. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,Come on. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,They signed the agreements and that's what we're going to live with. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,You could release them now. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"I'm sorry. No, the question is... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,I heard your question. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"... are the women bound by being muzzled by you and you could release them from that immediately? Because, understand, this is not just a question of the mayor's character. This is also a question about electability. We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against. [applause] That's not what we do as Democrats. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,Mr. Vice President? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Look, let's get something straight here. It's easy. All the mayor has to do is say, ""You are released from the nondisclosure agreement,"" period. [applause] We talk about transparency here. This guy got himself in trouble saying that there was a non -- that he couldn't disclose what he did. He went to his company... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Just to be super-clear, that was about the list of clients, so nobody gets the wrong idea. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"No, no, no. Yeah, I'm sorry. [laughter] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"I know what you mean. No, you're right. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"But he said -- he went to the company and said I want to be released, I want to be able to do it. Look, this is about transparency from the very beginning, whether it's your health record, whether it's your taxes, whether it's whether you have cases against you, whether or not people have signed nondisclosure agreements. You think the women, in fact, were ready to say I don't want anybody to know about what you did to me? That's not how it works. The way it works is they say, look, this is what you did to me and the mayor comes along and his attorneys said, I will give you this amount of money if you promise you will never say anything. That's how it works. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Mayor Bloomberg, final word to you? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,I've said we're not going to get -- to end these agreements because they were made consensually and they have every right to expect that they will stay private. [audience booing] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"If they want to release it, they should be able to release themselves. Say yes. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Can I add a word to this? You know, we talk about electability, and everybody up here wants to beat Trump, and we talk about stop and frisk, and we talked about the workplace that Mayor Bloomberg has established and the problems there. But maybe we should also ask how Mayor Bloomberg in 2004 supported George W. Bush for president, put money into Republican candidates for the United States Senate when some of us -- Joe and I and others -- were fighting for Democrats to control the United States Senate. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,And didn't support Barack. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Maybe we can talk -- maybe we can talk about a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. If that's a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Thank you, Senator. Vanessa, to you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Senator Klobuchar, you're running on your Washington experience. But last week in a Telemundo interview, you could not name the president of Mexico or discuss any of his policies. Last night, you defended yourself saying, quote, ""This isn't 'Jeopardy!'"" But my question to you is, shouldn't our next president know more about one of our largest trading partners? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Of course. [applause] Of course. And I don't think that that momentary forgetfulness actually reflects what I know about Mexico and how much I care about it. And I first want to say greetings to President Lopez Obrador. Secondly, I -- what I meant by the game of ""Jeopardy!"" is that I think we could all come up with things. You know, how many members are there in the Israeli Knesset? One hundred twenty. Who is the president of Honduras? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,Senator Klobuchar... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,Hernandez. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,Senator Klobuchar. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"But when it comes to Mexico, I am the one person on this stage that came out first to say I was for the U.S.-Mexican-Canadian Trade Agreement. That is going to be one of the number-one duties of a president is to implement that. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Senator Klobuchar, my colleague specifically asked you if you could name the president of Mexico and your response was no. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Yes, that's right. And I said that I made an error. I think having a president that maybe is humble and is able to admit that here and there maybe wouldn't be a bad thing. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Mayor Buttigieg, your response? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,But if you could let me -- if you could... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Yeah, I wouldn't liken this to trivia. I actually didn't know how many members were in the Knesset, so you got me there. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Well, there you go. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,But you're staking your candidacy on your Washington experience. You're on the committee that oversees border security. You're on the committee that does trade. You're literally in part of the committee that's overseeing these things and were not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Are you -- are you trying to say that I'm dumb? Or are you mocking me here, Pete? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,I'm saying you shouldn't trivialize that knowledge. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"I said I made an error. People sometimes forget names. I am the one that -- number one, has the experience based on passing over 100 bills... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Thank you, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"If I could respond, this was a pretty big allegation. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Quickly, please. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"He's basically saying that I don't have the experience to be president of the United States. I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat since being in the U.S. Senate. I am the one, not you, that has won statewide in congressional district after congressional district. [applause] And I will say, when you tried in Indiana, Pete, to run, what happened to you? You lost by over 20 points to someone who later lost to my friend, Joe Donnelly. So don't tell me about experience. What unites us here is we want to win. And I think we should put a proven winner in charge of the ticket. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Quick response, Mayor Buttigieg. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"This is a race for president. This is a race for president. If winning a race for Senate in Minnesota translated directly to becoming president, I would have grown up under the presidency of Walter Mondale. This is different. And the reason that I think we need to talk about Washington experience is that we should ask what that experience has led to. Experience and certainly tenure is not always the same thing as judgment. If we're going to talk about votes in the Senate in Washington, let's talk about it. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,Let's talk about a major policy... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Hello, hello, hello, hello. Thank you. Senator Warren and Mayor Bloomberg, this question is for you. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,I want to talk about -- maybe this is appropriate here. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"Can I just defend Senator Klobuchar for a minute? This is not right. I understand that she forgot a name. [applause] It happens. It happens to everybody on this stage. Look, you want to ask about whether or not you understand trade policy with Mexico? Have at it. And if you get it wrong, man, you ought to be held accountable for that. You want to ask about the economy and you get it wrong? You ought to be held accountable. You want to ask about a thousand different issues and you get it wrong? You ought to be held accountable. But let's just be clear. Missing a name all by itself does not indicate that you do not understand what's going on. And I just think this is unfair. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,Let me say something. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"You're right. But Senator Klobuchar could not discuss Mexican policy, either. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,I'm the only one who knows this man and met with him. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,I do have to respond. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Come on, man. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,I called him up. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"You have just invoked my name again, and I ask you to look at the interview I did directly after the forum, which we went into great detail on Latin American policy. And I want to say one thing about Mayor Pete where we just disagree. He was asked on a debate stage about the Mexican cartels, which are bad, bad criminal organizations. He said that he would be open to classifying them as terrorist organizations. I actually don't agree with that. That is a very valid debate to have. I don't think that would be good for our security coordination with Mexico, and I think you got that wrong. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Well, at least that's a substantive... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,I've spent more time in Mexico than anybody. Could I get a chance to say something? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Well, hold on. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,Mr. Vice President? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,Si. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Si, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Si, si. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Look, I'm the only one who's spent extensive -- hundreds of hours in Latin America. I've met with this president. I've met with the last president, the one before that. I've been deeply involved in making sure that we have a policy that makes more sense than this god-awful president we have now. I'm the guy that put together $750 million to provide help for those Latin American countries that are the reason why people are leaving, because there's nothing for them to stay for. I've spent hours and hours and hours. And so you want to talk about experience in Washington, it's good to know with whom you're talking. It's good to know what they think. It's good to know what you think. And it's good to be able to have a relationship. That's what it's about. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"All right. Well, we -- clearly everybody is warmed up. We're going to take a short break and kick off the next hour with a topic many voters have said is top of mind, the climate crisis. We're back in a moment. [commercial break] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Welcome back. We received hundreds of questions from Democratic voters, and many of them were about the climate crisis. It's an issue that uniquely impacted Nevadans. Jon Ralston from the Nevada Independent kicks us off now. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,RALSTON,"So y'all ready to play some Nevada trivia now? I'm only half-joking here. Let's talk about this issue, because it's up there in polls. Voters are really concerned about it, as you all know. What you might not know is that Las Vegas and Reno are the vibrant economic engines for the state of Nevada and are also two of the fastest warming cities in the country. In certain months of the year, the heat is already an emergency situation for residents and for tourists walking up and down the Strip. So I'm going to start with you, Mr. Vice President. What specific policies would you implement that would keep Las Vegas and Reno livable, but also not hurt those economies? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"It is the existential threat humanity faces, global warming. I went out to tech -- you have a facility where you have one of the largest, largest solar panel arrays in the world. And it's -- when the fourth stage is completed, it will be able to take care of 60,000 homes for every single bit of their needs. And what I would do is, number one, work on providing the $47 billion we have for tech and for -- to making sure we find answers is to find a way to transmit that wind and solar energy across the network in the United States. Invest in battery technology. I would immediately reinstate all of the elimination of -- of what Trump has eliminated in terms of the EPA. I would secondly make sure that we had 500,000 new charging stations in every new highway we built in the United States of America or repaired. I would make sure that we once again made sure that we got the mileage standards back up which would have saved over 12 billion barrels of oil, had he not walked away from it. And I would invest in rail, in rail. Rail can take hundreds of thousands, millions of cars off the road if we have high-speed rail. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,RALSTON,"Thank you, Mr. Vice president. I want to get some of the rest of you in on this because y'all have plans. Mayor Bloomberg, let me read -- let me read what you've said about this issue. You said you want to intensify U.S. and international actions to stop the expansion of coal. How exactly are you going to do that? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Well, already we've closed 304 out of the 530 coal-fired power plants in the United States, and we've closed 80 out of the 200 or 300 that are in Europe, Bloomberg Philanthropies, working with the Sierra Club, that's one of the things you do. But let's just start at the beginning. If you're president, the first thing you do the first day is you rejoin the Paris Agreement. This is just ridiculous for us to drop out. [applause] Two, America's responsibility is to be the leader in the world. And if we don't, we're the ones that are going to get hurt just as much as anybody else. And that's why I don't want to have us cut off all relationships with China, because you will never solve this problem without China and India, Western Europe, and America. That's where most of the greenhouse... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,RALSTON,I just... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Let me just finish one other thing. I believe -- and you can tell my whether this is right -- but the solar array that the vice president is talking about is being closed because it's not economic, that you can put solar panels in into modern technology even more modern than that. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,RALSTON,"All right. Mayor, I just -- I want to let Senator Warren jump in here, just because you've said something that's really specific to Nevada. And the tension here in this state is between people who want renewable energy and people who want conservation on public lands. Eighty-five percent of Nevada is managed by the federal government. You have said that you were going to have an executive order that would stop drilling on public lands, stop mining, which is a huge industry here. You've got to have lithium, you've got to have copper for renewable energy. How do you do that? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"So, look, I think we should stop all new drilling and mining on public lands and all offshore drilling. If we need to make exceptions because there are specific minerals that we've got to have access to, then we locate those and we do it not in a way that just is about the profits of giant industries, but in a way that is sustainable for the environment. We cannot continue to let our public lands be used for profits by those who don't care about our environment and are not making it better. Look, I'm going to say something that is really controversial in Washington, but I think I'm safe to say this here in Nevada. I believe in science. [applause] And I believe that the way that we're going to deal with this problem is that we are going to increase by tenfold our investment in science. There's an upcoming $27 trillion market worldwide for green. And much of what is needed has not yet been invented. My proposal is, let's invent it here in the United States and then say, we invent it in the U.S., you've got to build it in the U.S. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,We're going to... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,That's a million new manufacturing jobs. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"We're going to stick to this topic. But, Senator Sanders, I'm going to move to fracking. You want a total ban on natural gas extraction, fracking, in the next five years. The industry, obviously, supports a lot of jobs around the country, including thousands in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. One union official there told the New York Times, quote, ""If we end up with a Democratic candidate that supports a fracking ban, I'm going to tell my members that either you don't vote or you vote for the other guy."" What do you tell these workers, it's supporting a big industry right now, sir? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"What I tell these workers is that the scientists are telling us that if we don't act incredibly boldly within the next six, seven years, there will be irreparable damage done not just in Nevada, not just to Vermont or Massachusetts, but to the entire world. Joe said it right: This is an existential threat. You know what that means, Chuck? That means we're fighting for the future of this planet. [applause] And the Green New Deal that I support, by the way, will create up to 20 million good-paying jobs as we move our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. This is a moral issue, my friends. We have to take the responsibility of making sure that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and habitable. That is more important than the profits of the fossil fuel industry. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"I want to keep this going. Senator Klobuchar, you're not on the same page on a total ban of fracking. You call it a transitional fuel. But scientists are sounding this alarm now. Do you take these warnings that maybe fracking is a step backwards, not a step forward, not a transition? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"I have made it very clear that we have to review all of the permits that are out there right now for natural gas and then make decisions on each one of them and then not grant new ones until we make sure that it's safe. But it is a transitional fuel. And I want to add something that really hasn't been brought up by my colleagues. This is a crisis, and a lot of our plans are very similar to get to carbon neutral by 2045, 2050, something like that. But we're not going to be able to pass this unless we bring people with us. I'm looking at these incredible senators from Nevada -- Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen -- and I'm thinking that they know how important this is. And you can do this in a smart way. One, get back into that international climate change agreement. Two, clean power rules, bring those back. And the president can do this herself without Congress, as well as the gas mileage standard. But when it comes to putting a price on carbon -- this is very important, Chuck -- we have to make sure that that money goes back directly as dividends to the people that are going to need help for paying their bills. Otherwise, we're not going to pass it. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,Senator Warren... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,So there has to be a heart to the policy to get this done. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Senator Warren, address the worker issue, if you don't mind, as well. Can you address the worker issue? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,Yes. We can have a Green New Deal and create jobs. We need people in infrastructure who will help build. We have manufacturing... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"They could lose that job tomorrow, though. That's what they're concerned about. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"Yes, those jobs are for tomorrow. Those are the ones we need to be working on to harden our infrastructure right now. But listen to Senator Klobuchar's point. She says we have to think smaller in order to get it passed. I don't think that's the right approach here. Why can't we get anything passed in Washington on climate? Everyone understands the urgency, but we've got two problems. The first is corruption, an industry that makes its money felt all through Washington. The first thing I want to do in Washington is pass my anti-corruption bill so that we can start making the changes we need to make on climate. And the second is the filibuster. If you're not willing to roll back the filibuster, then you're giving the fossil fuel industry a veto overall of the work that we need to do. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Thank you. Vanessa -- Senator, thank you, Vanessa has got the next question. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,Can I respond? She mentioned me. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Vice President Biden, you have said that you want to hold oil and gas executives accountable for their role in harming our planet. You have even suggested that you might put them in jail. Which companies are you talking about? And how far are you willing to go? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"I'm willing to go as far as we have to. First of all, I would eliminate all the subsidies we have for oil and gas, eliminate it, period. That would save millions and millions -- billions of dollars. [applause] Number two, I think that any executive who is engaged -- and by the way, minority communities are the communities that are being most badly hurt by the way in which we deal with climate change. They are the ones that become the victims. That's where the asthma is, that's where the groundwater supply has been polluted. That's where, in fact, people, in fact, do not have the opportunity to be able to get away from everything from asbestos in the walls of our schools. I have a trillion-dollar program for infrastructure. That will provide for thousands and thousands of new jobs, not $15 an hour, but $50 an hour, plus benefits, unions, unions being able to do that. [applause] And what it does is, it will change the nature -- look, here's the last point I want -- and my time is going to run out. Here's the last point I want to make to you. On day one, when I'm elected president, I'm going to invite all of the members of the Paris Accord to Washington, D.C. They make up 85 percent of the problem. They know me. I'm used to dealing with international relations. I will get them to up the ante in a big way. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Vice President Biden, you didn't answer my questions. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,I thought I did. I'm sorry. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,What would you do with these companies that are responsible for the destruction of our planet? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"What would I do with them? I would make sure they, number one, stop. Number two, if you demonstrate that they, in fact, have done things already that are bad and they've been lying, they should be able to be sued, they should be able to be held personally accountable, and they should -- and not only the company, not the stockholders, but the CEOs of those companies. They should be engaged. And it's a little bit like -- look, this is the industries we should be able to sue. We should go after -- just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies. The only company we can't go after are gun manufacturers, because of my buddy here. But that's a different story... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"We're going to stay on the topic. My question is to Mayor Bloomberg. Mayor Bloomberg, your business is heavily invested in China. I think you mentioned that a few questions back. The number one producer in the world of carbon emissions. How far would you go to force China to reduce those emissions and tackle the climate crisis? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Well, you're not going to go to war with them. You have to negotiate with them and try to -- and we've seen how well that works with tariffs that are hurting us. What you have to do is convince the Chinese that it is in their interest, as well. Their people are going to die just as our people are going to die. And we'll work together. In all fairness, the China has slowed down. It's India that is an even bigger problem. But it is an enormous problem. Nobody's doing anything about it. We could right here in America make a big difference. We're closing the coal-fired power plants. If we could enforce some of the rules on fracking so that they don't release methane into the air and into the water, you'll make a big difference. But we're not going to get rid of fracking for a while. And we, incidentally not just natural gas. You frack oil, as well. It is a technique, and when it's done poorly, like they're doing in too many places where the methane gets out into the air, it is very damaging. But it's a transition fuel, I think the senator said it right. We want to go to all renewables. But that's still many years from now. And we -- before I think the senator mentioned 2050 for some data. No scientist thinks the numbers for 2050 are 2050 anymore. They're 2040, 2035. The world is coming apart faster than any scientific study had predicted. We've just got to do something now. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Mayor Buttigieg, your thoughts. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Let's be real about the deadline. It's not 2050, it's not 2040, it's not 2030. It's 2020. Because if we don't elect a president who actually believes in climate science now, we will never meet any of the other scientific or policy deadlines that we need to. [applause] So first of all, let's make sure we're actually positioned to win, which, once again, if we put forward two of the most polarizing figures on this stage as the only option, it's going to be a real struggle. Now, I've got a plan to get us carbon neutral by 2050. And I think everybody up here has a plan that more or less does the same. So the real question is, how are we going to actually get it done? We need leadership to make this a national project that breaks down the partisan and political tug of war that prevents anything from getting done. How do you do it? Well, first of all, making sure that those jobs are available quickly. Secondly, ensuring that we are pulling in those very sectors who have been made to feel like they're part of the problem, from farming to industry, and fund as well as urge them to do the right thing. And then global climate diplomacy. I'm a little skeptical of the idea that convincing is going to do the trick when it comes to working with China. America has repeatedly overestimated our ability to shape Chinese ambitions. But what we can do is ensure that we use the hard tools... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"All right, Mayor Buttigieg. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,Senator Warner? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,... to enforce what has to happen... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"Yes, I want to make sure that the question of environmental justice gets more than a glancing blow in this debate...[applause]...because for generations now in this country, toxic waste dumps, polluting factories have been located in or near communities of color, over and over and over. And the consequences are felt in the health of young African-American babies, it's felt in the health of seniors, people with compromised immune systems. It's also felt economically. Who wants to move into an area where the air smells bad or you can't drink the water? I have a commitment of a trillion dollars to repair the damage that this nation has permitted to inflict on communities of color for generations now. We have to own up to our responsibility. We cannot simply talk about climate change in big, global terms. We need to talk about it in terms of rescuing the communities that have been damaged. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Senator Warren, thank you. Hallie? [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Vice President Biden, I want to ask you about something else that is important to people here. I want to ask you about Latinos, owning one out of every four new small businesses in the United States. Many of them have benefited from President Trump's tax cuts, and they may be hesitant about new taxes or regulations. Will taxes on their small businesses go up under your administration? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"No. Taxes on small businesses won't go up. As a matter of fact, we're going to make sure there's more money available for small businesses in the Latino community and the black community to be able to get the capital to start businesses. And at the Treasury Department, there's going to be a window available where we significantly increase the amount of money available so people can borrow the money to get started. They have demonstrated they're incredibly successful. We should not be raising taxes on them. We should start rewarding work, not just wealth. That's why we have to change the tax code the way it is. That's why the wealthy have to start to pay their fair share. And that's why we have to focus on giving people the ability to garner wealth, generate wealth. And that's why this whole idea of red-lining, lending to people in areas wasn't the cause of Wall Street failing. The greed of Wall Street was the reason why it occurred, not red-lining. [applause] And lastly I want to say, look, the idea of China, China is -- and their Belt and Road proposal, they're taking the dirtiest coal in the world mostly out of Mongolia and spreading it all around the world. It's clear. Make it clear when you call them to Washington in the first 100 days, if you continue, you will suffer severe consequences because the rest of the world will impose tariffs on everything you're selling because you are undercutting the entire economy. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Mayor Buttigieg, will taxes on those businesses go up under you? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Not if they are small businesses. I mean, what we've got to do is level the playing field, where a company like Amazon or Chevron is paying literally zero on billions of dollars in profits and it puts small businesses, like the ones that are revitalizing my own city, often Latino-owned on our west side, at a disadvantage. We need to recognize that investing in Latino entrepreneurship is not just an investment in the Latino community, it is an investment in the future of America. And it is time for a president who understands the value of immigration in lifting up all of our communities and our country. We're getting the exact opposite message from the current president. And it is time to recognize not just the diversity of the Latino community, but the importance of issues like economic empowerment, like health care, as well as immigration. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,We have a tax system... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,We have an entrepreneurship gap in America. And that is a gap between white entrepreneurs and black and Latino entrepreneurs. And the principal reason for this is they don't have the money for equity to get the businesses started. It's about a $7 billion gap. We want to have real entrepreneurship and a level playing field. I have a plan to put the $7 billion in to have the fund managed by the people...

dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Look, I want to get into something. Mayor Bloomberg, the vice president talked about red-lining. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"As the only one here that started a business, maybe you... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Mayor Bloomberg, you seemed to imply that red-lining and stopping that is -- that stopping red-lining has somehow contributed to the financial crisis. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"No, that's exactly wrong. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"And that was the implication that came out in your quote, so I want to give you a chance to clarify this. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"I've been well on the record against red-lining since I worked on Wall Street. I was against during the financial crisis. I've been against it since. The financial crisis came about because the people that took the mortgages, packaged them, and other people bought them, those were -- that's where all the disaster was. Red-lining is still a practice some places, and we've got to cut it out. But it's just not true. What I was going to say, maybe we want to talk about businesses. I'm the only one here that I think that's ever started a business. Is that fair? OK. What we need is -- I can tell you in New York City, we had programs, they're mentoring programs for young businesspeople so they can learn how to start a business. We had programs that could get them seed capital. We had programs to get branch banking in their neighborhoods, because if you don't have a branch bank there, you can't get a checking account. You can't get a checking account, you can't get a loan. You can't get a loan, you can't get a mortgage. Then you don't have any wealth. There's ways to fix this. And it doesn't take trillions of dollars. It takes us to focus on the problems of small businesses. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Senator Sanders, 45 seconds, and then we're going to move on. Senator Sanders, 45 seconds. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"You know, when we talk about a corrupt political system, bought by billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg, it manifests itself in a tax code in which not only is Amazon and many other major corporations, some owned by the wealthiest people in this country not paying a nickel in taxes, we have the insane situation that billionaires today, if you can believe it, have an effective tax rate lower than the middle class. So maybe, just maybe... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,But you're re-writing the tax code. Why are you complaining? Who wrote the code? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,You did. You and your campaign... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,You and the other 99 senators.

dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Senator Klobuchar, I actually want to get you to something about -- Senator Sanders tweeted last year, ""Billionaires should not exist."" "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,OK. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,What say you? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"I believe in capitalism, but I think our -- the goal of someone in government and a president of the United States should be a check on that. I'm not going to limit what people make, but I think right now our tax code is so tilted against regular people and that is what's wrong. I was thinking of your question about small businesses. The small businesses I talked to, they have trouble getting employees because their employees don't have childcare. We should have universal childcare. [applause] And we have not been talking enough about Donald Trump and -- let's just talk about Donald Trump, because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy, and he went down to Mar-a-Lago and he said to all his friends, ""You just got a lot richer."" That is Exhibit A. And I can tell you, the hard-working people in Nevada were not in that room. So the key to me is to not limit what people can make, but make sure that we have a government that is fair for everyone. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"So, Senator Sanders, what did you mean that you don't think they should exist? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,I'll tell you what I mean. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,What did that mean? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"We have a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income. Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans. That's wrong. That's immoral. That should not be the case when we got a half a million people sleeping out on the street, where we have kids who cannot afford to go to college, when we have 45 million people dealing with student debt. We have enormous problems facing this country, and we cannot continue seeing a situation where, in the last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth -- congratulations, Mr. Bloomberg -- but the average American last year saw less than a 1 percent increase in his or her income. That's wrong. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Mayor Bloomberg, should you exist? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"I can't speak for all billionaires. All I know is I've been very lucky, made a lot of money, and I'm giving it all away to make this country better. And a good chunk of it goes to the Democratic Party, as well. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,Is it too much? Have you earned too much -- has it been an obscene amount of -- should you have earned that much money? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,Yes. I worked very hard for it. And I'm giving it away. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"All right, thank you. Hallie? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Mayor Buttigieg, Senator Sanders has a proposal that will require all large companies to turn over up to 20 percent of their ownership to employees over time. Is that a good idea? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"I think that employee ownership of companies is a great idea. I'm not sure it makes sense to command those companies to do it. If we really want to deliver less inequality in this country, then we've got to start with the tax code and we've got to start with investments in how people are able to live the American dream, which is in serious, serious decline. As a matter of fact, last time I checked, the list of countries to live out the American dream, in other words, to be born at the bottom and come out at the top, we're not even in the top ten. Number one place to live out the American dream right now is Denmark. And as the, I think, lone person on this stage who's not a millionaire, let alone a billionaire, I believe that part of what needs to change is for the voices of the communities that haven't felt heard on Wall Street or in Washington to actually be brought to Capitol Hill. It's why I am building a politics designed around inclusion, designed around belonging, because the one thing that will definitely perpetuate the income inequality we're living with right now is for Donald Trump to be re-elected, because we polarized this country with the wrong nominee. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Senator Sanders, it's your policy. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Can I -- to me, right? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,It is your policy. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Thank you, it is my policy, and I'm very proud of that policy. All right? What we need to do to deal with this grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is make sure that those people who are working -- you know what, Mr. Bloomberg, it wasn't you who made all that money. Maybe your workers played some role in that, as well. [applause] And it is important that those workers are able to share the benefits, also. When we have so many people who go to work every day and they feel not good about their jobs, they feel like cogs in a machine. I want workers to be able to sit on corporate boards, as well, so they can have some say over what happens to their lives. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Mayor Bloomberg, you own a large company. Would you support what Senator Sanders is proposing? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Absolutely not. I can't think of a ways that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get re-elected than listening to this conversation. [applause] It's ridiculous. We're not going to throw out capitalism. We tried. Other countries tried that. It was called communism, and it just didn't work. [audience booing] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"So let me make a proposal that will work, that has not only support from a majority of Democrats, but also from a majority of the independents and a majority of Republicans. And that is a two-cent wealth tax on all fortunes above $50 million. You hit a billion, you've got to pay a few pennies more. This is a tax on the top one-tenth of one percent in America. And it permits us to start to restructure our economy. It means we can afford universal childcare for everybody baby in this country age zero to five. It means we can have universal pre-K for every child in America. It means we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher and stop exploiting the black and brown women who do this work. [applause] It means we can put $800 billion into our public schools, quadruple funding for Title I schools. And as a former special education teacher, we could fully fund IDEA so children with disabilities would get the full education they need. [applause] We can do college. We could put $50 billion into our historically black colleges and universities. And we could cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Senator, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"That's something a majority of Americans support, a two-cent wealth tax. It is a question of values. Do we want to invest in Mr. Bloomberg? Or do we want to invest in an entire generation of young students? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Senator Sanders, my next question is for you. Senator Sanders, our latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday, two-thirds of all voters said they were uncomfortable with a socialist candidate for president. What do you say to those voters, sir? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,What was the result of that poll? Who was winning? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,The question -- the question is to you. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"The question was that I was winning, and I think by a fairly comfortable margin. Might mention that. But here is the point. Let's talk about democratic socialism. Not communism, Mr. Bloomberg. That's a cheap shot. Let's talk about -- let's talk about what goes on in countries like Denmark, where Pete correctly pointed out they have a much higher quality of life in many respects than we do. What are we talking about? We are living in many ways in a socialist society right now. The problem is, as Dr. Martin Luther King reminded us, we have socialism for the very rich, rugged individualism for the poor. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,Wait a second. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"When Donald -- let me finish. When Donald Trump gets $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury condominiums, that's socialism for the rich. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,Wait a second. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"When Walmart -- we have to subsidize Walmart's workers who are on Medicaid and food stamps because the wealthiest family in America pays starvation wages, that's socialism for the rich. [applause] I believe in democratic socialism for working people, not billionaires, health care for all, educational opportunities for all. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"All right, Senator, Senator, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Creating a government that works for all, not just for Mr. Bloomberg. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,The question was about socialism. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,What a wonderful country we have. The best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses. What did I miss here? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Well, you'll miss that I work in Washington, house one. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,That's the first problem. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Live in Burlington, house two. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,That's good. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"And like thousands of other Vermonters, I do have a summer camp. Forgive me for that. Where is your home? Which tax haven do you have your home? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"New York City, thank you very much, and I pay all my taxes. And I'm happy to do it because I get something for it. And let me say, I thought the senator next to me was half right. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,Elizabeth. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"I agree we should raise taxes on the -- I disagree with the senator on the wealth tax but I do agree with her that the rich aren't paying their fair share. We should raise taxes on the rich. I did that as mayor in New York City. I raised taxes. And if you take a look at my plans, the first thing I would do is try to convince Congress, because they've got to do it, we can't just order it, to roll back the tax cuts that the Trump administration put in with the -- through Congress. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"All right, Vice President Biden, weigh in on this question of Americans' feeling about socialist candidates. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Well, look, let me weigh in on -- you know, for 36 years and as vice president, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress. I made money when I wrote a book about my son and it surprised me how much it sold. First time I've ever made any money. And here's the deal. The fact is that we ought to start rewarding work, not just wealth. The idea that we have a tax rate for corporate America at 21 percent is ridiculous. It should be at 28 percent. That would raise almost $800 billion a year. The idea that we have companies not paying anything at all, they should have a minimum tax of 15 percent. That would raise another $740 billion a year. The idea that you're able to have a capital gains tax that you pay at the rate of 20 percent if you are -- if you're Mike Bloomberg or whomever that has a whole lot of money, and someone else who's paying at -- your staffer is paying at 25 percent is wrong. That would raise another $800 billion. We should be rewarding work, not just wealth. And the American people, the middle class is getting killed, and the poor have no way up. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"All right, Vice President Biden, thank you. Chuck? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Mayor Buttigieg, I want to get you in on this, because, you know, in 2000, you wrote an award-winning essay. You praised Senator Sanders. You specifically praised him for embracing socialism. You have now since said that you are concerned about his policies. But I am curious about this. Are you out of touch with your own generation, millennials by a big chunk embrace his version of democratic socialism, you do not. Are you out of touch with your generation? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"No. Look, it's true that I was into Bernie before it was cool. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,Thank you. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"He was a congressman at the time. And the qualities I admired then are qualities I still respect a great deal. I never said that I agree with every part of his policy views, then or now. But I appreciate that at least he's straightforward and honest about them. He's honest about the fact that taxes will go up on anybody making more than $29,000 to fund his health care plan, although, again, a little bit vague about how the rest of that gets... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,You're not being honest. Premiums would be eliminated. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,But you're still raising those taxes. And when you do it... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"But we're saving people money because they don't pay any premiums, out-of-pocket expenses, co-payments, or deductibles. They're going to be much better off. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"But where is -- where is the other $25 trillion supposed to come from? At a certain point, you've got to do the math. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Well, we got it all up there on the internet. It's a payroll tax -- a payroll tax... [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Well, no, but even after the payroll tax, you still have a hole. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Because we have a wealth tax. Elizabeth has a good one. Ours is a little bit tougher on Mr. Bloomberg than hers. We're going to raise it in a progressive way, which deals with income and wealth inequality, and makes certain, finally, that health care in this country is a human right, not a privilege. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,Could I... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Forty-five seconds. Senator Warren, I'm just going to close it out here. You went out of your way -- you went out of your way to call yourself a capitalist, to separate yourself... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"Yes, because I am. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,... from him. Why? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"Yes, because I am. Look, Democrats want to beat Donald Trump, but they are worried. They are worried about gambling on a narrow vision that doesn't address the fears of millions of Americans across this country who see real problems and want real change. They are worried about gambling on a revolution that won't bring along a majority of this country. Amy and Joe's hearts are in the right place, but we can't be so eager to be liked by Mitch McConnell that we forget how to fight the Republicans. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,Mayor Buttigieg has been taking money from big donors and changing his positions. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,That's just not true. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"So it makes it unclear what it is he stands for, other than his own... [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Senator, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, go ahead. You've got -- Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar, go ahead, you've got the floor for 45. Go. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Thank you. Number one, I have repeatedly said that we have to win big. And the way we win big is winning states like Nevada, but also winning the Senate races in Arizona and in Colorado and beyond. [applause] And the reason we want to do that is to send Mitch McConnell packing. And I think, when you look at my history, I am the one that has done that. I am the one that can lead this ticket. And just because I am willing to talk about common ground, that's where America is. It is not with Mitch McConnell, who has 400 bills on his desk that should pass if we get rid of him. It is because I am willing to work... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,OK. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,May I respond? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"... with people and find common ground, and that's what we want in a president, Elizabeth. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,We don't want someone that looks at just plans. The difference between... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Senator, thank you. We need to take another break here. We'll return to the Paris Las Vegas in just a moment. [commercial break] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Welcome back to Las Vegas and the Democratic presidential debate. To kick off our next round of questioning, here's Hallie. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Mayor Buttigieg, to you. In 2018, Mayor Bloomberg was the biggest outside spender helping Democrats running for Congress. He's also donated billions toward causes like climate change, gun safety, education. If his money wasn't a problem then, why is it a problem now? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Oh, I think he should absolutely be doing everything in his power to defeat Donald Trump. I just don't think that has to result in him becoming the president of the United States. Look, our party has values. We were built around values like making sure we protect working people. But Mayor Bloomberg opposed raising the minimum wage. Our party has a tradition that includes excellent presidents like Barack Obama, who Mayor Bloomberg opposed. At the end of the day, it's not just about how much money you've got. It's what you stand for. And we are living in a moment when Americans are so deeply frustrated with the way that both Wall Street and Washington seem to have overlooked our lives. The view from the porch of my one house in Indiana...[laughter]...is that they can't even see us sometimes. And if we're going into the election of our lives against a president who rose to power by cynically exploiting the frustration of ordinary Americans feeling like leaders weren't speaking to them, then I think that turning to someone like Mayor Bloomberg, who thinks he can buy this election, is no better a way to succeed than turning to somebody like Senator Sanders who wants to burn the house down. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,Mr. Vice President? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"You know, if you excuse a point of personal privilege, they used to say, it was said that I was in the pocket of Mitch McConnell. I'm the only person on this stage that's beaten Mitch McConnell on four major, major cases. Let me finish. [applause] Let me finish. And Mitch McConnell -- I've been the object of his affection and the president's affection, the way he's gone after me, this new Republican party, after me, after my son, after my family. I don't need to be told I'm a friend of Mitch McConnell's. Mitch McConnell has been the biggest pain in my neck in a long, long time. And so that's number one. Number two, we have to have somebody who understands what it's like for ordinary people. Ordinary people come up. They have to understand, like my dad made that longest walk up a short flight of stairs and said, ""I don't have a job, honey, we have to move. You've got to move with Grandpa."" How long it took to buy a house, how long it took to get back in the game again. They have to understand the needs of ordinary people. And they are getting killed, no matter what people say about this economy, how good it is. And the good part of the economy, this -- it's only 60 seconds. It's not up yet. And the fact is that we are in a situation where you have, Mayor, the -- excuse me, the president making clear that he doesn't want any part of me being his opponent. He's spending $125,000 this week to keep me from being the opponent. I wonder why. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Vanessa, to you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,So can I respond to the vice president? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Thank you, Hallie. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,He's identifying me specifically in this. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Forty-five seconds to you, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,I was identified. I was responding to an accusation. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"So, no, the point is different. Here's what happened. According to the New York Times,"" the last time that Mitch McConnell was on the ballot, the vice president stood in the Oval Office and said, ""I hope that Mitch gets reelected so I can keep working with him."" Well, Mitch did get -- Mitch did get re-elected. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,That's totally out of context. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"He did not have an epiphany. Instead, he blocked nearly everything that Barack Obama tried to pass. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,Did you ever win anything? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,And he stole a Supreme Court seat from Democrats. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,Come on. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. Our next question goes to Senator Klobuchar. About 700,000 young people known as Dreamers, or Sonadores, who were brought to this country as children, are currently protected from deportation because of a program that is now under the review by the Supreme Court. If the court sides with the Trump administration, which is eager to end this protection, what exactly is your plan to protect the Dreamers permanently? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"To win, to beat Donald Trump. The best way to protect the Dreamers is to have a new president. There are the votes there to protect the Dreamers. And I have been working on this since I got to the United States Senate. In my first campaign, I actually had a bunch of ads run against me because I was standing up for immigrants. And when I think of Dreamers -- and I try to explain it to my state -- I found a 99-year-old Hispanic war veteran who was a Dreamer when he was brought over to this country. And back then, he just went to Canada for a night and came back and he was a permanent citizen, because they needed him to serve in World War II. Now, not so easy. The Dreamers are our future. The Dreamers are so important in Nevada. And the best way we can get this done is to beat Donald Trump, but it is to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which creates a path to citizenship to so many hard-working people, will bring down the deficit by $158 billion, and will bring peace for these Dreamers. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Thank you so much, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,They know no other country but our own. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,Thank you. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,If you're going to run based on... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,Mayor Pete? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"If you're going to run based on your record of voting in Washington, then you have to own those votes, especially when it comes to immigration. You voted to confirm the head of Customs and Border Protection under Trump, who is one of the architects of the family separation policy. You voted to make English the national language. Do you know the message that sends in as multilingual a state as Nevada to immigrants? You have been unusual among Democrats, I think the Democrat among all of the senators running for president most likely to vote for Donald Trump's judges, who we know are especially hostile to Dreamers and to the rights of immigrants. Now, in South Bend, it was not always easy to stand up in a conservative place like Indiana on immigration. But we delivered. We created a municipal ID program so that Dreamers and others who were undocumented were able to navigate everyday life. We stood up for those rights and stood with members of our community with the message that they were as American as we are. [speaking Spanish] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Thank you. Gracias, gracias, Mayor Pete. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,I wish... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,Senator Klobuchar? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete. But let me tell you what it's like to be in the arena. Number one, do the math. If my friend, Andrew Yang, was up here, that's what he'd say. In fact, I have opposed, not supported, two-thirds of the Trump judges, so get your numbers right. And I am in the top 10 to 15 of opposing them. Number two, when it comes to immigration reform, the things that you are referring to, that official that you are referring to was supported by about half the Democrats, including someone in this room. And I will say this: He was highly recommended by the Obama officials. Do you know why? Because Trump had so few career people. I did not one bit agree with these draconian policies to separate kids from their parents. And in my first 100 days, I would immediately change that. And I would add one more thing. I have been in the arena. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,"Thank you, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Ted Kennedy -- he had made a pretty big allegation against me again, and I think I should have a right to respond. He had... [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"I'm stating the facts, because these are votes that you took, and those votes set you alone among the Democrats running for president. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,That is just... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,No other -- is it true or is it false that no other Democrat from the Senate running for president voted that way? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"First of all, it is -- what you've said about the judges are false. You are comparing me to two colleagues up here on this stage, and you are forgetting one thing. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Well, I would say anybody who ran for president this cycle, Senator Harris, Senator Booker saw through this. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"You know what, Pete? If you could let me finish, since I've been in the arena. Ted Kennedy asked me to work on the first immigration bill. We were able with President Bush to at least get that bill to a vote. I'm sorry that Senator Sanders actually opposed that bill, and I worked on it. And if we had gotten that bill done, there would have been a path to citizenship for so many people. Then I worked on the 2013 bill. I'm actually so proud of the work I have done on immigration reform. And you know what? You have not been in the arena doing that work. You've memorized a bunch of talking points and a bunch of things, but I can tell you one thing. [applause] What the people of this country want, they want a leader that has the heart for the immigrants of this country, and that is me. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"You know, maybe leading a diverse city that was facing ruin doesn't sound like the arena to you. I'm used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important than mayors, but this is the arena, too. You don't have to be in Washington to matter. You don't have to be on Capitol Hill for your work to be significant. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,Can we talk more... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Guys, guys, we are at the end here. We are at the end here. I've got to let that one go. We are less than two weeks away from a national primary. And I want to ask all of you this simple question. There's a very good chance none of you are going to have enough delegates to the Democratic National Convention to clench this nomination, OK? If that happens, I want all of your opinions on this. Should the person with the most delegates at the end of this primary season be the nominee, even if they are short of a majority? Senator Sanders, I'm going to let you go last here, because I know your view on this. [laughter] So instead, I will start with you, Mayor Bloomberg. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Whatever the rules of the Democratic Party are, they should be followed. And if they have a process, which I believe they do... "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"OK, I'm trying to do this yes or no to make it fast. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,... everybody else -- everybody can... 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,So you want the convention to work its will? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,Yes. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,Senator Warren? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,But a convention working its will means that people have the delegates that are pledged to them and they keep those delegates until you come to the convention. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,Should the leading person? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,All of the people. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,OK. All righty. Vice President Biden? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,Play by the rules. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Yes or no, leading person with the delegates, should they be the nominee or not? "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"No, let the process work its way out. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,Mayor Buttigieg? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,Not necessarily. Not until there's a majority. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,Senator Klobuchar? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,Let the process work. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,Senator Sanders? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Well, the process includes 500 super-delegates on the second ballot. So I think that the will of the people should prevail, yes. The person who has the most votes should become the nominee. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Thank you, guys. Five noes and a yes. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,We are not done yet. We're back with more from Las Vegas after a short break. [commercial break] 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Welcome back, everyone. It is time for closing statements. Each candidate will have one minute. And we begin with Senator Klobuchar. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,"This has been quite a debate. [laughter] And what I want everyone out there watching to remember is that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us and that we need a candidate that can bring people with her. [applause] Yes, a fired up Democratic base, but also independents and moderate Republicans. And I have done that every single time. I have won every race down to fourth grade. A lot of boasting up here, so thought I'd add that. [laughter] Secondly, you need someone who can govern. And I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat. And, third, you need someone that has the heart to be the president. They were talking a lot about heart conditions up here. We have a president right now that doesn't have a heart. [applause] I love the people of this country. And I ask for the vote of the people of Nevada, because this state gets it. They get that maybe you don't agree with every single thing that's said on this debate stage, but we understand that the heart of America is bigger than any heart that guy has in the White House. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Senator Klobuchar, Senator Klobuchar, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,KLOBUCHAR,I ask you to join me at amyklobuchar.com. Thank you. 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,"Senator Klobuchar, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Mayor Bloomberg, to you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BLOOMBERG,"Well, you can join me at mikebloomberg.com, too, if you want, but I'm not asking for any money. [laughter] Look, this is a management job, and Donald Trump's not a manager. This is a job where you have to build teams. He doesn't have a team so he goes and makes decisions without knowing what's going on or the implications of what he does. We cannot run the railroad this way. This country has to pull together and understand that the people that we elect -- and it's not just the president of the United States -- they should have experience, they should have credentials, they should understand what they're doing and the implications thereof. And then we should as a society try to hold them accountable so the next time they go before the voters, if they haven't done the job, we shouldn't just say, oh, nice person, gives a good speech. We should say, didn't do the job and you're out of here. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,JACKSON,"Mr. Mayor, thank you. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,TODD,"Mayor Buttigieg, one minute. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Nevada, I'm asking for your vote because America is running out of time and this is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump. If you look at the choice between a revolution or the status quo and you don't see where you fit in that picture, then join us. And, yes, go to peteforamerica.com and help out, because we need to draw everybody that we can who believes that we need to empower workers, who believes in climate science, who believes in doing something about gun violence and recognizes that the only way we can do this is to create a sense of belonging in this country that moves us out of the toxic and polarized moment that we are living in today. I already see an American majority ready to do these things. Now we have a responsibility to galvanize, not polarize, that majority. We cannot afford to lean on the same Washington playbook. We cannot afford to alienate half the country. We must step forward into the future in order to win and in order to govern a country that will be facing issues the likes of which we barely thought of just a few years ago. I'm asking you to join me so that we can deliver that future together. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HAUC,Senator Warren? 
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,WARREN,"I grew up fighting. I grew up out in Oklahoma, and I learned it probably from my mother. I watched when my daddy had a heart attack and didn't have any money coming in, when our car was lost and when we were on the edge of losing our home. I watched my mother fight to save our family. And I grew up fighting to save our family, my family. I eventually made it through school and spent my life as a teacher, and looking into why it is that so many families across this country are struggling and why it gets worse year after year after year. I for years have fought for unions to say the way we're going to restructure this economy is we're going to get -- make it easier to join a union and get more power into unions. To fight for students who have been cut out of opportunity over and over because of the rising cost of an education. Look, for me, I am -- of all the people on this stage, I have been a politician the shortest time, but I've been the one out fighting for families the longest time. I promise you this: Give me a chance, I'll go to the White House and I'll fight for your family. "

dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,BIDEN,"Look, I'm running because so many people are being left behind. People I grew up with in Scranton, when my dad lost his job, lost his house, had to move. We moved to Claymont, we found ourselves in a position where we had little ability to get anything done. And my dad worked like hell. I've learned a lot. I've been knocked down a whole hell of a lot. I know what it's like to be knocked down. But I know we have to get back up. We have to provide some safety and security for the American people. Right here in Nevada, the site of the most significant mass murder in American history, guns. Our kids are getting sent to school having to hide under desks, learning how to run down corridors to avoid being shot. It's immoral. I'm the only one that's beaten the NRA nationally, and I beat them twice. With regard to health care, it also is something that is a right. Obamacare has to be expanded. It can be, in fact, cover everybody. And lastly, I think it's important that on day one, day one, we deal with sending an immigration bill to the desk. The only person in here that has a worse record on immigration is Bernie, because Bernie voted against the 2007 bill. "
dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,HOLT,All right.

dem_primary_debate_2_19_20,SANDERS,"Unfortunately, LULAC, among other groups, Latino groups, saw that bill having provisions akin to slavery, Joe. But the bottom line is, all of us are united in defeating the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. That we agree on. But where we don't agree, I think, is why we are today the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people, why three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, when 500,000 people sleep out on the street, why hundreds of thousands of bright young kids can't afford to go to college, and 45 million remain in student debt. Bottom line here: Real change never takes place from the top on down, never takes place from an oligarchy controlled by billionaires. We need to mobilize millions of people to stand up for justice.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,ANNOUNCER,America decides. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,America deserves a president who is as resilient as her people. [cheering and applause] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,2020 is our time to change who makes the rules. [cheering and applause] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,ANNOUNCER,One stage. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"This election is just too important, and we cannot afford to get it wrong. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,There's no limit to what we could get done in the next four years. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,Show up in November of 2020 and win. [cheering and applause] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,ANNOUNCER,Seven Democratic candidates. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"Together, we have built a movement. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,We have a fantastically diverse and wonderful party. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,We choose hope over fear. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,We are going to unite together. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"And, together, we are going to get it done. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,We will deliver a democracy worthy of the name. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"We are here, and we are strong. [cheering and applause] [end videotape] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,ANNOUNCER,"Live from the Gaillard Center in Charleston, South Carolina, this is the CBS News Democratic debate. Here are the seven candidates for the presidential nomination. [cheering and applause] O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Good evening, and welcome. The Democratic presidential primary here in South Carolina, the first primary in the South, is just four days away. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"And Super Tuesday is just a week away. And this is the biggest primary day of the year, as voters in 14 states cast ballots, and many of them tell us they have not actually made up their mind. So, this debate, when you think about it tonight, may be the last, best chance for the candidates to make their case to South Carolina and Super Tuesday voters. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"And CBS News is proud too bring you this debate, along with our co-sponsors. They are the Democratic National Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating voters and training political leaders. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"And we are partnering tonight also with Twitter. So, you at home can participate in this debate. How do you do that? Send us your questions for the candidates using the Twitter hashtag #DemDebate. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Now, here are the rules for the next two hours. When you are asked a question, you will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer, and 45 seconds for follow-ups. So, let's begin. Senator Sanders, we haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower. How will you convince voters that a Democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Well, you're right. The economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires. [applause] In the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth. But you know what? For the ordinary American, things are not so good. Last year, real wage increases for the average worker were less than 1 percent. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck; 87 million Americans have no health insurance or are underinsured; 45 million people are struggling with student debt; 500,000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street, including 30,000 veterans. That is not an economy that's working for the American people. That's an economy working for the 1 percent. We're going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,Senator... O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Mayor Bloomberg... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,Senator...[cheering and applause]Senator... O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Mayor Bloomberg, I'll let you respond to that. Do you think Senator Sanders' economy would be better for America than President Trump's? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"I -- I think that Donald Trump thinks it would be better if he's president. I do not think so. Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States. And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Oh, Mr. Bloomberg. Let me tell Mr. Putin, OK, I'm not a good friend of President Xi of China. I think President Xi is an authoritarian leader. And let me tell Mr. Putin, who interfered in the 2016 election, try to bring Americans against Americans, hey, Mr. Putin, if I'm president of the United States, trust me, you're not going to interfere in any more American elections. [cheering and applause] O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Senator Warren? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Look, we know what the president -- what Russia wants. It's chaos. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"So, look, the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas, even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don't want to say so. [applause] You know, but Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie. And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard, and it's going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help rein in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance. But I dug in. I fought the big banks. I built the coalitions, and I won. Bernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Thank... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"I dug in. I did the work. And then Bernie's team trashed me for it. We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done. Progressives have got one shot. And we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Mayor Buttigieg, we want to bring you in this conversation. [cheering and applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Why would the Russians want to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"I will tell you what the Russians want. They don't have a political party. They want chaos. And chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs. Donald Trump. [laughter] Think about what that will be like for this country. [applause] And, meanwhile, folks at home, from South Carolina to South Bend, are trying to figure out what any of this means for us, because it's right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up, and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But, also, there's a majority of the American people who I think right now just want to be able to turn on the TV, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof. [cheering and applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,We have an opportunity to set a different tone. O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Mr. Steyer. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Mr. Steyer. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"Bernie Sanders' analysis is right. The difference is, I don't like his solutions. I don't believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant, competitive private sector. But we all know, unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer is not for the government to take over the private sector, though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Vice President Biden? [applause] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"We need to -- well, let me just finish, because we need to have an alternative to Donald Trump. I'm talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10 percent for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over 4.5 million good-paying union jobs. [applause] Donald Trump thinks -- he's incompetent as a steward of the American economy. We have to show that we can create a growing, prosperous economy that works for American working people. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Gayle? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Mr. Steyer, thank you. Your time is up. [cheering and applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Vice President Biden? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"You know, when we talk about progressive, let's talk about being progressive. Walking distance of here is Mother Emanuel Church, nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and wanted a waiting period...[cheering and applause] No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama -- he wanted a primary-- he said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should, and, in fact, the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, this is -- let's talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done, and that's what we got done. We got a lot done [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, your response. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"You know, Pete mentioned -- I'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. [laughter] I wonder why. And maybe, you know, Pete mentions what the American people want. I will tell you, Pete, what the American people want, and, Joe, what the American people want. They don't want candidates to be running to billionaires for huge amounts of funding. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"All right, let's clear this up once and for all. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Pete has gotten funding from over 50 billionaires. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,You've got people believing something that is false. This needs to be cleared up. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Joe, I think, has gotten a little bit more. What the American people want, by the way, and a lot of the issues we'll be discussing tonight are issues I raised four years ago: raising the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. Making public colleges and universities tuition-free. And finally, doing what every other major country on Earth does, guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right through a Medicare for All, single-payer system. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,I can't allow -- I can't allow this to stand because it's just not true. Senator Sanders... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,We're going to allow everyone an opportunity opportunity to respond. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,... has got people believing something that is untrue about my campaign. The idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"I didn't say that, Pete. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Fifty people, all right. In Charleston alone, just in Charleston, over 2,000 people have contributed to my campaign. That means the dollars that have come to my campaign, just from Charleston, is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned. Grassroots contributions are the life blood of my campaign. In fact, I shouldn't miss the opportunity, if you're watching right now and you support my campaign, go to peteforamerica.com, and chip in. And if you are watching right now, and you're a billionaire, I will raise your taxes. But if you'd like to defeat Donald Trump, please go to peteforamerica.com and donate legal maximum of $2,800, if you're a billionaire. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, all right, Mayor Buttigieg. Vice President Biden, I want to make -- I want to bring us to another topic. We're in South Carolina. It's the first primary with a significant black voting population. Your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters. And I'm wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Well, first of all, the latest poll I saw, my numbers -- I'm still 15 points ahead, the latest poll. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Yes, yes, you're correct. You're correct. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"But look, look... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,But Senator Sanders is in striking distance of you. You are within the margin of error in this state. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Well, it depends which -- look, I've earned the vote, I've worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African-American community, not just here but across the country. I've been coming here for years and years, creating jobs here, making sure that the port, for example, that employs one in 11 people, we put $500 million, in our administration, just into this county. We've created jobs for people. The people know me. My entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties. I don't expect anything. I plan to earn the vote. I'm here to ask. I'm here to earn it. But, folks, I intend to win in South Carolina, and I will win the African-American vote here in South Carolina. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Mr. Biden, will you continue if you do not win South Carolina? You have said that South Carolina will determine the outcome of this presidential race. If you don't win South Carolina, will you continue in this race? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,I will win South Carolina. [applause] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, sir. Mayor Bloomberg, I'd like to bring you into this conversation. I want to ask you about a question that impacts the black and brown community. You've apologized for stop and frisk repeatedly. What exactly are you apologizing for? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"We let it get out of control and when I realized that, I cut it back by 95 percent. And I've apologized and asked for forgiveness. I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time. But let me tell you, I have been working very hard. We've improved the school system for black and brown students in New York City. We've increased the jobs that are available to them. We've increased the housing that's available to them. We have programs like the... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"But what more can you do about this issue, Mr. Mayor, to put people's fears and skepticism to rest? It continues to follow you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"No -- well, that's because it's in their interest to promote that. But if you talk to the people in New York City, I have over 100 black elected officials that have endorsed me. A lot of them are in the audience tonight. And I've earned the respect of people in New York City. I was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the United States for 12 years, and people will tell you it's a lot better city today. It is safer for everybody. The school system is better. The budget is under control. We've done the things that people need in New York City for all ethnicities. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Mayor Buttigieg, mayor to mayor, mayor to mayor, you've certainly had your issues with the black community as well. Do you think the New York City's implementation of stop and frisk was racist? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Yes, in effect, it was. Because it was about profiling people based on their race. And the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little. And I'm not here to score points. I come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community. And I come to this with some humility because I'm conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice. None of us -- none of us have the experience, the lived experience of, for example, walking down the street, or in a mall, and feeling feeling eyes on us, regarding us as dangerous, without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin. None of us had the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by, of going into a doctor, and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race. Since we don't have the experience, the next best thing we can do... O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Thank you, Mayor. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,... is actually listen to those who do. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"I know -- wait a second. I know that if I were black, my success would have been a lot harder to achieve. And I know a lot of black people that if they were white it would have been a lot easier for them. That's just a fact, and we've got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator Klobuchar, was the way that the mayor implemented stop and frisk racist? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Yes, and I think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we're going to go forward. Martin Luther King once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. So when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it. And to me that means sentencing reform, like the First Step Act, and extending that to the states with the Second Step Act. It means equal opportunity. Because if we don't pass Representative Clyburn's bill out of South Carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we're never going to get to that single garment of destiny. And we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. And then, finally, voting. While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls. Georgia kicked 100,000 off. As president, I will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Senator Warren, I'm coming to you. I want to direct this question to you because you -- because Mayor Bloomberg has said he got in this race late because he doesn't believe that any of you on stage can beat Donald Trump. You said Mayor Bloomberg is not the safest candidate, he is the riskiest candidate. What did you mean by that? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"I mean that Mayor Bloomberg -- let's think of it this way. We're here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week is Donald Trump. He's going to be here to raise money for his buddy Senator Lindsey Graham, who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for re-election last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg. And that's not the only right-wing senator that Mayor Bloomberg has funded. In 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point. In 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard. [applause] I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will. And the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the Democratic Party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, Senator Warren, thank you. Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond? Mayor Bloomberg? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"I have been training for this job since I stepped on the pile that was still smoldering on 9/11. I know what to do. I've shown I know how to run a country. I've run the city which is almost the same size -- bigger than most countries in the world. I am not the -- I'm the one choice that makes some sense. I have the experience. I have the resources. And I have the record. And all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that. When people hired me to run New York City three times, in an overwhelmingly Democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Mr. Vice President? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,I was mentioned in this. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,No... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,I'd like to respond. O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Go ahead, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,He called me out by name. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,There was a -- I thought... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"... and referred to what I talk about as a ""sideshow."" You know, this is personal for me. When I was 21 years old, I got my first job as a special education teacher. I loved that job. And by the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant. The principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else. Pregnancy discrimination, you bet. But I was 21 years old. I didn't have a union to protect me. And I didn't have any federal law on my side. So I packed up my stuff, and I went home. At least I didn't have a boss who said to me, ""Kill it,"" the way that Mayor Bloomberg is alleged to have said... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"I never said that. Oh, come on. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,... to one of his pregnant employees. People want a chance to hear...[audience booing]...People want a chance to hear from the women who have worked for... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"I never said that. And for the record, if she was a teacher in New York City, she would never have had that problem. We treated our teachers the right way, and the unions will tell you exactly that. [applause] O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Well, Mayor Bloomberg, Senator Warren has raised... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"Then let us -- let us have -- the women have an opportunity to speak. The Bloomberg corporations and Mayor Bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination. They are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak. If he says there is nothing to hide here, then sign a blanket release and let those women speak out... [applause] [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,... so that they can tell their stories the way I can tell my story without having the fear they're going to be sued by a billionaire. [crosstalk] O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Thank you. Thank you. We have a number of issues to discuss tonight, but I want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond, because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace. At the last debate, you said some of your female employees might not have liked some of your jokes. Did these women take your jokes wrong? Or were you wrong to make the jokes? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"Probably wrong to make the jokes. I don't remember what they were. So I assume -- if it bothered them, I was wrong, and I apologize. I'm sorry for that. But what happened here is we went back 40 years and we could only find three cases where women said they were uncomfortable. Nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two. And what the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement. I did that two days later, and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again. The senator has got it. And I don't know what else she wants us to do. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"Oh, I'll be clear. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,We're following exactly what she asked to do. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,I'll tell you exactly what I want you to do. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"And the trouble is with this senator, enough is never enough for what this -- I'm going to start focusing on some of these other things. We just cannot continue to re-litigate this every time. We did what she asked. And, thank you, we've probably made the world better because of it. And by my company renouncing using these, we probably changed, hopefully, the corporate landscape all across America. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"If you get nominated, we'll be re-litigating this all year. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"Sorry, Mayor, you did not do what I asked. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Senator Warren, that is a very serious charge that you leveled at the mayor. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,Yes. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,He told a woman to get an abortion. What evidence do you have of that? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,Her own words. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"And, Mayor Bloomberg, could you respond to this? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"I never said it, period, end of story. Categorically never said it. When it was accused -- when I was accused of doing it, we couldn't figure out what she was talking about. But right now, I'm sorry if she heard what she thought she heard, or whatever happened. I didn't take any pleasure in that. And we've just got to go on. But I never said it. Come on. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,What I asked the mayor to do is to do a release of all people who have discrimination claims... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"We are doing that, Senator. [crosstalk] O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,We want to get to the -- we want to get to the issue -- we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the Democratic Party. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,OK. O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator Sanders, the cost of your agenda. Yesterday, you released information about how you will pay for your major proposals, but not all of your details are clear. You've proposed more than $50 trillion in new spending. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Over a 10-year period. O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,You've said Medicare for all will cost $30 trillion. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Over a 10-year period. O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,But you can only explain how you'll pay for just about half of that. Can you do the math for the rest of us? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,How many hours do you have? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Two. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,That's the problem. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"No, it's not the problem. All right, let's talk about Medicare for all. I'm sure you're familiar with the new study that just came out of Yale University, published in Lancet magazine, one of the prestigious medical journals in the world. You know what it said? Medicare for all will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save 68,000 lives of people who otherwise would have died. What we need to do is to do what every other major country on Earth does : guarantee health care to all people, not have thousands of separate insurance plans, which are costing us some $500 billion a year to administer. Our plan -- we have laid out options all over the place. One of the options is a 7.5 percent payroll tax on employers, which will save them substantial sums of money. Another... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Bernie, let me -- let me respond to this. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,You asked me a question. O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator Klobuchar, does the math add up? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"No, the math does not add up. In fact, just on ""60 Minutes"" this weekend, he said he wasn't going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes. Well, let me tell you how many nickels and dimes we're talking about: nearly $60 trillion. Do you know how much that is, for all of his programs? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Not true. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"That is three times the American economy -- not the federal government -- the entire American economy. The Medicare for all plan alone on page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. That is true. As one prominent Democrat once said, we should pay attention to where the voters of this country are, Bernie. That prominent Democrat was Barack Obama a few months ago. And I think that's what we should do. They are not with you on spending nearly $60 trillion. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,First of all... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"What I think we should do is make things more affordable, nonprofit public option, make sure we're paying for long-term care better, take on the pharmaceuticals, like you and I have done together... O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Thank you, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,... and do something for the people of America.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,Instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Mr. Steyer -- Mr. Steyer... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,I think we're talking about math. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"We'll get to you, Mr. Sanders. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,Let's talk about it. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,Can I say something? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,First of all... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"No, let me go. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"No, I think -- Tom, I think she was talking about my plan, not yours. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"I think we were talking about math, and it doesn't take two hours to do the math. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"No, no, well, let's talk about math. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,Because let's talk about what it adds up to. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Let's talk about math. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Let's talk about math, indeed. OK, so here's the math... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,If we do nothing is what... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"No, here's the math. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Excuse me, can I respond to the attack? [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,To do nothing is what will happen... [crosstalk] O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator Sanders, you are allowed a quick response and then we would like to allow the other candidates... [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Listen to the moderator, guys. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator Sanders, you have been name checked. You are allowed to respond. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"OK. What the Health and Human Services have said in analyzing health care costs, what Yale -- recent Yale study has said is that your program would cost some $50 trillion over a 10-year period. We would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs. What every study out there -- conservative or progressive -- says, Medicare for all will save money. Ours will cost about $45 billion, not $60 trillion. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Bernie, I was talking about -- I was talking about... [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"We would like -- Senator Sanders, we would like to bring Mr. Steyer in on this conversation. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"Mr. Steyer, please. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,I was talking about all your programs. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"Excuse me, Amy. This conversation shows a huge risk for the Democratic Party. We are looking at a party that has decided that we're either going to support someone who is a democratic socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a Republican. And let me say that I got into this race because I wanted to fight for economic justice, for racial justice, and to make sure we had climate justice for the American people. And I am scared. [applause] If we cannot pull this party together, if we go to one of those extremes, we take a terrible risk of re-electing Donald Trump. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,And that is something -- I still have some time. And let me say this. O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,That is a risk that will hurt the American people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk. O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Thank you. Let's keep this topic going. Mayor Pete? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"So let's do this math. Senator Sanders at one point said it was going to be $40 trillion, then it was $30 trillion, then it was $17 trillion. That's an incredible shrinking price tag. At some point, has said it is unknowable to even see what the price tag would be. Now there are new numbers. I'll tell you exactly what it adds up to. It adds to four more years of Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, and the inability to get the Senate into Democratic hands. The time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters. Not only is this a way to get Donald Trump reelected. [cheering and applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,We got a House to worry about. We got a Senate to worry about. And this is -- this is really important. Look... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,Hello? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"... if you want to keep the House in Democratic hands, you might want to check with the people who actually turned the House blue, 40 Democrats, who are not running on your platform. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can. [cheering and applause] I want to send those Democrats back to the United States House. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Vice President Biden. [cheering and applause] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,Let's listen to them... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Vice President Biden.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I guess the only way you do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should. [laughter] Here's the deal. Here's the deal. Look, a guy who's a friend of mine down here named Fritz Hollings -- he passed away -- he said, you want to know what a woman will do, look what they have done. Look what they have done. You talk about -- concerned about race. Well, my good friend on the end of this platform, he, in fact, bought a system that was a private prison system, after, after he knew that, in fact, what happened was, they hog-tied young men in prison here in this state. They, in fact, made sure that, in Georgia, they did not have health care for the people who were being held. They, in fact, went on, and he said, after he knew that, he bought it. And then he said he was proud of his accomplishment. You talk about what we're talking about with Bernie. Bernie, in fact, hasn't passed much of anything. The fact of the matter is... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,OK. But I get to answer. [cheering and applause] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"No, no, no. "

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"No, that... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,... fact is... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,You're out of time. I get to answer... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Here's the deal. I'm not out of time. You spoke over time, and I'm going to talk. Here's the deal. [cheering and applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Here's the deal. The fact of the matter is, look at what's happening here. Look at what's happening here. We have to win the Senate back. And, by the way, I went into all of those races that got 41 new Democrats. The majority of them are supporting me for president and endorsing me. [cheering and applause] O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"And, Mr. Vice President, I have to allow -- yes, Mr. Mayor. [crosstalk] O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Mr. Mayor, you're allowed to respond. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,I bought stock in a prison company thinking they would do a better job. And I investigated. And I sold it. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,OK. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,But you knew -- you knew when you bought it they'd done that. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"I get to answer this question. And, in fact, since then, I have worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state, and we have ended it. I have started a bank to support black ownership of businesses, women ownership of businesses, and Latino owners of businesses, because this financial service industry is prejudiced. I have worked tirelessly on this. And you know I'm right. You wrote the crime bill that you called... [crosstalk] "

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,Tommy come lately. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Mayor Bloomberg. Mayor Bloomberg. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"... if we spend the next four months tearing our party apart, we're going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,Look... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"So, my argument here is that we need to get back to what's happening right now. We have a clear choice of who's going to lead this party. And I am the only one in the New Hampshire debate, when asked, if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket, that raised my hand. I like Bernie. We came in together to the Senate. But I do not think that this is the best person to lead the ticket. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"And if you want to talk about getting things done and make a comparison, according to Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, last Congress, I was the most effective Democrat in the U.S. Senate on 15 metrics. Bernie and Elizabeth were in the bottom half. It matters -- it matters if you can actually get things done. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,OK. Gayle... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"It is not just who talks the best, who actually gets things done. And especially with the African-American community, there have been a lot of broken promises.. And I think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for these people matters. And that's why I ask for your support. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Mayor Bloomberg, please. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"Let's just go on the record. They talk about 40 Democrats; 21 of those were people that I spent $100 million to help elect. All of the new Democrats that came in and put Nancy Pelosi in charge and gave the Congress the ability to control this president...[cheering and applause]...I -- I got them. Number two, when you talk about money, let's put this in perspective. The federal budget is $4.5 trillion a year. We get $3.5 trillion in revenue. We lose $1 trillion a year. That's why the federal budget -- deficit is -- right now, the debt is $20 trillion, going up to 21. We just cannot afford some of this stuff people talk about. But if you... [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"Let me finish. If you keep on going, we will elect Bernie. Bernie will lose to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump and the House and the Senate and some of the statehouses will all go red. And then, between gerrymandering and appointing judges, for the next 20 or 30 years, we're going to live with this catastrophe. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Mayor Bloomberg, thank you. [cheering and applause.] I will allow Senator Sanders a quick response, and then Senator Warren. "

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Thank you very much. Mayor Bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support. The problem is, they're all billionaires. [booing] Now, if you look -- oh. On the other hand, of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally, Mr. Bloomberg, I beat Trump 47 of those 50 times. If you look at battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, polling just done this Sunday... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,The polls aren't the election. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"... I beat Trump. And if you want to beat Trump, what you're going to need is an unprecedented... [applause] "

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Thank you. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,That's what our movement is about. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,Can anybody -- can anybody in this room imagine moderate Republicans going over and voting for him? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Absolutely.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Thank you. Senator Warren. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"That is the problem. And that is that a progressive agenda is popular, Mayor Bloomberg. And, for everyone on this stage, we talk about how to build a future. That's what matters. I talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on health care. It's why I also have a way to pay for health care that doesn't raise taxes on middle-class families. But it's so much more than that. As Democrats, we need to speak to the future we can build together. We need to speak of the prosperity we can build together. How about a wealth tax in America? Because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one-tenth of 1 percent, we have a chance to invest in universal child care for every one of our babies, to really level the playing field. O'"

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator, thank you. [cheering and applause] We have to take a quick break. When we come back, the Democratic presidential debate continues right after this, only on CBS. [cheering and applause] [commercial break] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"I'm Gayle King with Norah O'Donnell. Joining us now on the question here in Charleston, South Carolina are CBS News colleagues, the A team, Bill Whitaker of ""60 MINUTES,"" chief Washington correspondent, that's Major Garrett, and Margaret Brennan, moderator of ""FACE THE NATION."" We're going to begin with you, Vice President Biden, for this part. Just across the street, as you mentioned at the top of the debate, is the theater [sic] where nine people were shot and killed inside the Mother Emanuel Church. We all remember that day back in 2015. And every day in our country, over 100 people die from gun violence. You all have plans, I know, on this stage, to address the gun crisis. But Congress has not been able to pass a major gun legislation in a quarter of a century. And just think about this, in those 25 years we've had Columbine, Newtown, Parkland, Las Vegas. We could go on and on. Vice President Biden, I want to start with you, why should anyone have faith that you're the one who can get this done now? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Because I'm the only one that ever got it done nationally. I beat the NRA twice. I got assault weapons banned. I got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them. I got them eliminated. Except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in Florida and it was not reauthorized. In addition to, that I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend to my right and others have in fact also gave into the gone manufacturers, absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we'd give immunity to drug companies. We would give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on. Carnage on our streets. And I want to tell you, if I'm elected, NRA, I'm coming for you, and gun manufacturers, I'm going to take you on and I'm going to beat you. I'm the only one who has done it. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,That's why we have got to change what Washington can deliver. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"So this is about being able to dig in and talk about what really it's going to take to get something done. I've been in the Senate. What I've seen is gun safety legislation introduced, get a majority, and then doesn't pass because of the filibuster. Understand this, the filibuster is giving a veto to the gun industry. It gives a veto to the oil industry. It's going to give a veto on immigration. Until we're willing to dig in and say that if Mitch McConnell is going to do to the next Democratic president what he did to President Obama, and that is try to block every single thing he does, that we are willing to roll back the filibuster, go with the majority vote, and do what needs to be done for the American people. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,We're going to stay on this top and allow Senator... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,... and I can beat Mitch McConnell. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"Understand this, many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster. Until we're ready to do that, we can't have real change. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,I want to allow Senator Sanders to respond because you've gone after the insurance industry. You've taken on pharmaceutical companies. And you've taken on big tech. Why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Well, you know, Joe has voted for terrible trade agreements. [booing] No, no, no, no, no. Joe voted for the war in Iraq. My point was, not to be -- I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes. That was a bad vote. I have today a D-minus voting record from the NRA. Thirty years ago, I likely lost a race for the one seat for Congress in Vermont because 30 years ago, I opposed -- I supported a ban on assault weapons. Thirty years ago. Right now, my view is we need to expand background checks, end the gun show loophole, and do what the American people want, not what the NRA wants. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"OK, but wait a second... [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,... the opposition to the filibuster is not a discretion from a long time ago. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"I think she recognized me, thank you. I have a 6 million-person organization around this country. Moms Demand Action and Everytown. [applause] We have put background checks -- we have got background checks in 20 states. So you can do it. It's Congress that can't seem to do it. And I don't know why we think they're going to do it. The vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the NRA. And certainly Senator Sanders has supported the NRA. But we can do this. We have just got to stop talking about it. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,But the way we do it -- the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually needs the votes. So I have long supported the assault weapon ban. I am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an AK-47. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,I wrote that law. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"That bill, along with -- you didn't write that bill. I wrote that bill. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"I wrote the bill, the Violence Against Women Act... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,OK. You did you that. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,... that took out of the hands of people who abused their... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,OK. We'll have a fact check look at this. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,Let's look at the fact check... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,Oh my goodness. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"The only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered. I couldn't get that covered. You, in fact, when you were -- as a senator tried to get it covered and Mitch McConnell is holding it up on his desk right now, and we're going to lose the Violence Against Women Act across the board. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"OK. So, if I could finish. I have the bill. Anyone can check it out, to close the boyfriend loophole. Also to close the Charleston loophole is another bill that is out there. Universal background checks. But let me say how we win this. We have got to win in the middle of the country. And while everyone talks about winning rural areas, suburban areas, I'm the only one up here with a receipts that has actually repeatedly, while being for the assault weapon ban, won in Republican congressional districts over and over again, including Michele Bachmann's district. So having someone that can lead the ticket, that can bring people with her, is the way you get gun safety legislation. I look at these proposals and say, do they hit my uncle Dick in the deer stand? They do not. So coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator Klobuchar, thank you. We want to allow many people to get in on this topic. Mayor Buttigieg. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"I'm definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country. But I want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took, this is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds. [applause] And we're in South Carolina. How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change? We are in this state...[booing]. We are in the state where Strom Thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly. No less a Senate traditional figure than Harry Reid has called for it to go. It has got to go, because otherwise Washington will not deliver. I was in high school when the Columbine shooting happened. And I remember everybody in Washington saying, never again, we'll never let this happen again. And then a second school shooting generation has now been produced. Shame on us if we allow there to be a third. And also... [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"... in terms of making the case, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea for somebody to illustrate, from the perspective of the a veteran, why the kinds of weaponry, anything remotely like what I trained on in order to go serve in a war zone has no business being sold anywhere near an American school or church or neighbor. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, Senator Sanders, please. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Thirty years ago, I supported a ban on assault weapons. Mike Bloomberg has started a very good organization, Moms Demand Actions. Congratulations. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,Thank you. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"They have credited me with gun sense, as you know. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"Yes, we did. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Furthermore, furthermore, it is my view, the time is now, and Joe made this point, look, at the end of the day we need to rally the American people. Here is the good news. Because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings, the American people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety, not be dictated to by the NRA. And I am proud that I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. If elected president, it will get worse than that. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, Mr. Steyer, please? Mr. Steyer? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"Look, it isn't a question of the American people deciding that we have too much gun violence. Everyone in America knows we have too much gun violence. The problem we have is that corporations have bought Washington, D.C. The gun manufacturers own the Senate of the United States. So even though more than 90 percent of Americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase, we can't get it through the Senate. So the question you have to ask yourself is, how do we change the Senate of the United States in a material way? And there are two things. That's why I am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator, to change who's in charge, to get rid of Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz. [applause] But I am also -- Senator Sanders is right. We need to win a huge victory across the board. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, Mr. Steyer. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,Democrats need to go to the grassroots. I built one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the United States. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Your time's up, sir. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"The way to win at the grassroots is, tell the truth and organize. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,That's what it's going to take in 2020. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,"Let's talk about education. South Carolina's schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment. Black students here consistently score worse than white students. Mayor Bloomberg, a key element of your response to failing schools in New York City was a dramatic increase in public charter schools. As president, would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"I'm not sure they're appropriate every place. I can only tell you, in New York, they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them. We had -- the charter schools are mixed in with the non-charter public schools, because our charter schools are public schools, as well. They've helped each other. I saw a statistic the other day, when I came into office, zero New York City schools were in the top 25 of the state. When I left, 23 out of 25 were from New York City. We've cut the gap between the rich and the poor. We've made an enormous difference in all of the options that parents have. I raised teacher salaries by 43 percent. I put an extra $5 billion into our school system. I value education. It is the only way to solve the poverty problem is to get people a good education. And rather than just talk about it in New York, we actually did it. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,Senator Warren? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"So this is one thing where a president can make a big difference all by herself. And I'm going to start with my secretary of education. My secretary of education will be someone who has taught in public school. [applause] My secretary of education will be someone who believes in public education. And my secretary of education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools. [applause] One more thing. My secretary of education will believe that it is time to get rid of high-stakes testing. We need to support our children. But, look, we want to build a future in this country? We build a future by investing in our children. I've got a plan to put $800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,"Thank you. Thank you, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,Education is not free. We must invest in the future of our children. [applause] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,Senator Sanders? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"This campaign, our campaign, our campaign is about changing American priorities. Instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we're going to have high-quality, universal childcare for every family in this country. Because the psychologists tell us 0 to 4 are the most important years of human development. We are going to triple funding for low-income Title I schools, because kids' education should not depend upon the ZIP Code in which they live. We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free through a tax on Wall Street speculation. And we're going to move to make certain that no teacher in America earns less than $60,000 a year. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,"Thank you, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,We want great teachers. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,Can I... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,Mayor Buttigieg? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Look, the best thing that we can do to support public education is to support public educators. I'm a little biased, because I'm married to one. And I get an education about education every day I come home. I have seen how teachers are expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms. Teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we don't have an adequate mental health system to support kids. And now some politicians, because they aren't willing to face the need for commonsense gun law, are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there's a threat to a classroom. We have to show not only with compensation, but with support for the profession overall our regard for those who are educating our kids. And, yes, that means a secretary of education who will support teachers. It also means investing. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,Thank you... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,I'm proposing an education access... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,One way we -- one way we can support our teachers is to cancel student loan debt. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,We're going to pass this on to Major. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"Candidates, good evening. Candidates, good evening. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,People across this country are being crushed by student loan debt. This is an issue we need to talk about. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"And that's what my plan would do, through the education... [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"As we all know, as we all know, the political conversation in our country is interactive, and because of our partner, Twitter, this debate is no different. So I want to put a question from Twitter to you, Senator Klobuchar. This is from Casey Pennington. How will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Thank you. This is one of the first times we've talked about housing. And I put forward an extensive policy. I think -- when I've looked at this both in my job in local government and in the Senate, one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live. So the way you do that is, first of all, taking care of the Section 8 backlog of applicants. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting. And I have found a way to pay for this and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing. Secondly, you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and, third, to help people pay for it. And I want to make clear, given South Carolina and the rural population, as well as urban, that this isn't just an urban problem. It's a big urban problem, but it's also a rural problem, where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there, but they're not able to get housing. So for me, it's building a coalition. And I actually like to get these things done and to -- the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,This is a point... [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"Senator Warren, hold on one second, because I want to -- I want to... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"This is a point where we need to talk about race, though. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,I understand. [crosstalk] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,It is not enough to talk about housing neutrally... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,Can we just speak up when we want to? Is that the idea? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,... and just be race-blind. It is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against African-Americans having an opportunity to buy homes. [applause] That's red-lining. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,Mayor... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"And while Mayor Bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on African-Americans and on Latinos, in fact, I was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages. We have a -- I have a housing plan, and what it has in it specifically... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"Senator Warren, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,... is a piece... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"Senator Warren, thank you. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"... to deal with the effects of red-lining. We can no longer pretend that everything is race-neutral. We have got to address race consciously, what's happening in this country. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"OK. Mayor Bloomberg, please, we were going to ask you about this. I want to give you a chance to respond, because in addition to what Senator Warren just said on Twitter, she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red-lining. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"Yes, she's -- I'm sorry, but, unfortunately, she's misinformed on red-lighting. You can go back and look at the record. I fought against it before '08, the crisis, during '08, and after that. Red-lining is not the problem with the mortgage market, but it was a problem for the communities where it was done, and we stopped that. Let me also say, because just -- since I have the floor for a second, that I really am surprised that all of these -- my fellow contestants up here, I guess, would be the right word for it...[laughter]... given nobody pays attention to the clock -- I'm surprised they show up, because I would have thought after I did such a good job in beating them last week, that they'd be a little bit afraid to do that. [audience booing] But let me just say, when you're talking about affordable housing, we created 175,000 units of affordable housing in New York City. And I listened to them. They're in Congress and they say they can't get it done, can't get it done. But if you change something like the president, they would. No, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done. I did it in New York City. I got the Republican State Senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country. You can work across the aisle. You just have to know how to deal with people. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much. Back to you, Bill. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,"Vice President Biden, black men earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by white men, are about twice as likely to be unemployed, five times more likely to be incarcerated, conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both Democratic and Republican administrations. How do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Two ways. Number one, my entire life I've been involved with the black community. I was a public defender. I worked in the projects, I came along, and the first thing I did as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, extended the Voting Rights Act eventually for 25 years. And I have been deeply involved. And my first effort I had as a councilman was doing away with red-lining in the county. The way we do this, we've got to help them create wealth, and that's why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs, are as successful as any other group of people in the country. We go from 1.5 billion to $3 billion, taking $30 billion off the sidelines. That's how you create wealth. Secondly, I provide for the opportunity for first-time home buyers to be able to have a $15,000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it. Thirdly, I go after those people who are involved gentrification, because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense. They're being bought out. You cannot find a place to live. And thirdly, I make sure that with regard to housing, we allow people -- look, right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has, your house is valued significantly less than the white, the same exact house. We've got to deal with the institutional racism. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"I note how you cut me off all the time but I'm not going to be quiet anymore, OK? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,Mr. Steyer. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"Every single policy area in the United States has a gigantic subtext of race. We're talking about education. We're talking about criminal justice. We're talking about housing. We're talking about loans. I started a bank to basically correct the injustice in the financial services industry. Basically, to make loans to black-owned, Latino-owned, and women-owned businesses. We've supported over 8,000 affordable housing units. But more than that, I believe I'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"Something happened. We should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400-plus years in America of African-Americans, of systematic legal injustice, discrimination, and cruelty, but also of 400-plus years of contribution in terms of building the United States of America and leading the United States of America from a moral standpoint. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WHITAKER,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"Senator Klobuchar, next question, new topic, new topic. Senator Klobuchar... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"... for this whole campaign, I don't know where you got the impression... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"If you could honor the rules of the debate, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, I'd like to change topics and ask you, rural areas have populations who are older, sicker, and poorer than non-rural communities. And they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it. Expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to. So how would you ensure that there is available health care in rural areas? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"People aren't always aware, I know you are in South Carolina, about how much poverty there is, particularly child poverty in rural areas. So the answer is one size doesn't fit all. And one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they're designated for rural areas. And actually, I am leading -- the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered. The other issue is we don't have enough personnel. And so that's where we get to this education plan.. And I don't want agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard-earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college. What I think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy. We're going to have a million openings for home health care workers, particularly in rural areas, that we don't know how to fill. We're going to have over 100,000 openings for nursing assistants. We're not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees. We're going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses. So putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback, making one- and two-year degrees free, and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go, especially medical students, into rural areas. Final thing is comprehensive immigration reform. I have passed... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"Senator, time. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,I have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. We need to expand that. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"Mayor Buttigieg, the floor is yours, would you like -- same question. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Yes, so, when I was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy, if you were born in a rural area or a city. Now the gap is the biggest it has been in a generation, and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like South Carolina. We're seeing hospital closures right and left. And we're seeing them, in particular, in states where Medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression. See, all of these things are connected, housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations. And that harms everyone. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"You're out of time, sir. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"It's why in my Frederick Douglass plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues, part of the core of it is a 21st Century Voting Rights Act. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,Senator Sanders. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Yes, I'm very proud working with Congressman Jim Clyburn, South Carolina, that we increased funding for the Community Health Center Program by $11 billion as part of the Affordable Care Act, which now provides for 9 million Americans access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs, in that bill. We also put $2 billion into a program which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors, nurses, dentists, we have a major dental affordable crisis in this country, to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas. The advantage of a Medicare for All health care program, because it's not driven by profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies, we will have health care for all people in all parts of this country. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,But in order for any of that to happen it has to pass. And we're talking about a plan that... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,Thank you. Next topic. Gayle? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,... even goes beyond even what they do... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"I'm sorry, we're going to go to Mayor Bloomberg. We're going to change topics. Mayor Bloomberg, as mayor of New York, you declared war on obesity, you banned trans-fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same thing with large surgary drinks. So if you become president, will you push those policies on the national level as well? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"Well, I think what's right for New York City isn't necessarily right for all the other cities, otherwise you would have a naked cowboy in every city. So let's get serious here. But I do think it's the government's job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives. The -- we are a country where there are too many people that are obese. We should do something about that. But just a look what happened with smoking. We did ban smoking in New York City in public places, restaurants, offices, and that sort of thing. And it has spread across America, across Europe, across Latin America, even into places in the Middle East and into the Far East. It has saved an enormous number of lives. So it just goes to show, if you have good public health, then you can do things. And one of the great problems today, you read about the virus, what's really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago. So there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"And he has defunded -- he had defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing. As you see, the stock market is falling apart because people are really worried and they should be. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,We're going to talk about that. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,We don't have anybody to respond. I'm sorry. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"We're going to talk about that in our next segment. Before I leave you, are New Yorkers living longer because of your policies? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,There's no question about that. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,All right. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"Before I left, life expectancy in New York City had grown by three years during our 12 years in office such that, when I left, it was three years greater than the national average. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right. Vice President Biden, please. Vice President Biden. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Look, one of the things we have to do, we have a thing in the Defense Department called DARPA, a special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal to make us safer. They came up with the internet, I mean, they came up with the internet, they came up with the whole idea of stealth technology. I'm going to do the same thing at the National Institute of Health. We're going to focus at least $50 billion over the first five years on -- focusing on obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cancer. And we're going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment. We can, in fact, find cures if we make the investment, and we can get that done. The American people support it. Even Republicans will support it. We have to focus on extending life, saving life, and making people -- put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely. [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, Senator Biden, thank you. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sanders wants to legalize marijuana on day one of his presidency...[applause]... and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession. As a former prosecutor, is that a a realistic promise? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Well, it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana, I want to do that, too. And I also think you need to look back and -- at people's records and you maybe can't do it on day one, as he said. I think you want to have a process that you go through, because there's too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs. I think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment. And it's not necessarily because of marijuana. It is because of things like opioids and the like. And that's why one of the first plans I put out was for treatment, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work, you don't want to have repeat customers, and you want to help people to get off of drugs. And the way you do that is with drug courts. The way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the White House so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the Justice Department, and while getting their advice. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, thank you, Senator Klobuchar. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Norah, can I respond? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Mayor Bloomberg... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Can I respond to that, as well? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Can I respond? I was mentioned... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"I'd like to get your thoughts on this, because you have called marijuana another addictive drug that we've never done research on. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"Look, the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. For dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before. [applause] Number two, we're not going to take it away from states that have already done it. But, number three, you should listen to the scientists and the doctors. They say go very slowly. They haven't done enough research. And the evidence so far is worrisome, before we get all our kids, particularly kids in their late teens, boys even more than girls, where this may be damaging their brains. Until we know the science, it's just nonsensical to push ahead. But the cat's out of the bag. So some states have it, you're not going to take it away. Get rid of the -- decriminalize the possession. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, thank you, Mr. Mayor. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator Sanders, you were name checked. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Thank you. All right, look, you're right. We have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken, it is racist, got more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China. And one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs. So I do believe that, on day one, we will change the Federal Controlled Substance Act, which, if you can believe it, now equates heroin with marijuana. That's insane. We're going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalize marijuana in every state in the country. What we are also going to do is move to expunge the records of those people who were arrested for possession of marijuana. [applause] And I'll tell you what else we're going to do. We're going to provide help to the African-American, Latino, Native American community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana, rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, Senator Sanders, thank you... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,I wrote the drug court bill.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"Look, a president's job, first job, is to keep America safe, and an important part of that is to have a strong military. All three of my brothers served in the military, and I understand how much the military sacrifices, how much their families sacrifice, and how much they are willing to put on the line. That means that we have a sacred responsibility to them, and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. We are not winning in Afghanistan. We are not winning in the Middle East. What we need to do is we need to use all of the tools in our toolbox. We need a strong military. We also need a strong State Department. Those are our eyes and ears on the ground. They are our frontlines in diplomacy. We need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy, and we need strong alliances. We need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm. And we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators. We need not to cut and run on our allies. And we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators. We need not to cut and run on our allies. We need an approach that keeps us safe by using all of the tools in a measured way. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Mayor Bloomberg, voters have not heard much about your foreign policy views. Would you pull all combat troops out of the Middle East? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"No. You want to cut it back as much as you can, but I think, if we learned something from 9/11, people plan things overseas and execute them here. We have to be able to stop terrorism. And there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it, but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate, and to not do so is just irresponsible. We shouldn't be fighting wars that we can't win. We should go to war only as a last resort. Nobody argues with that. But this is a dangerous world. And if we haven't learnt that after 9/11, I don't know what's going to teach us what to. This -- we have to do something, and I think the budget that we -- the things that I've seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they have been in an awful long time, and that the monies they are spending on the war of weapons we need for the next war and not for the last, a common mistake that they're not making now. O'"

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,They're doing a good job. O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg. Gayle? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Mayor Buttigieg, I'd like to go to you as the only veteran on stage. Can you weigh in on this? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Well, the first time I ever set foot in South Carolina, it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near Fort Jackson. And that was to get ready to go to Afghanistan, where I saw that one of the things that kept me safe, just as sure as my body armor, was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word. Our allies and our adversaries knew it. The president has torn that to shreds. And so the first thing we've got to do is restore the credibility of the United States. [applause] The second thing we've got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities -- and I guess I disagree with the mayor; I don't think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather, because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world. But we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground. But what good is that if you have a president who won't listen to them? Right now, some of the biggest threats that we face are not only things like counter-terrorism but issues like global health security and the Coronavirus, that rely on the ability to listen to scientists... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Time, Mr. Mayor. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,... listen to your own intelligence and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated because his idea of a security strategy is a big wall. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,I know it goes fast...[applause]...but a minute-fifteen is really a long time. [laughter] So we'd ask respectfully if you would all please try to keep to the time. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,Good idea. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Senator Klobuchar -- good idea, right, Mr. Vice President? Senator Klobuchar, today -- as we were coming over here today...[laughter] I promise, Mr. Vice President, we are going to get to you today. I promise. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"You keep promising me that, but you haven't done it yet. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,I've never broken a promise. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Well, let's get to it. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Senator Klobuchar... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Why don't you let me answer, OK? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"There was breaking news from the CDC about the Coronavirus. And so far there have been 2,700 deaths globally, and so far in this country there have been no deaths. But the CDC says this. ""It's not a matter of if the virus will spread here but when."" The question to you is this, would you close the borders to Americans who have been exposed to the Coronavirus in order to prevent an outbreak here in this country? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Well, what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those Americans and that they are in a quarantine situation. We don't want to expose people, but we want to give them help. And I would agree, when Mayor Bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget -- he tried to cut back on the CDC; he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world; he hasn't yet really addressed the nation on this topic, I would do all of that. But I want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the American people because this is so serious. I'm not going to give my website right now. I'm going to give the CDC's website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider. Because many doctors are saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here. And I think the answers, as president, what would I do, I would better coordinate throughout my presidency to be ready for the next pandemic and to prepare for this one. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Thank you, Senator. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"I would have better relations with our allies and I would support, because I know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school, in Columbia, South Carolina, or Houston, Texas, and it's investing in education, so we are ready to lead, again, in the world. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator, thank you. [applause] Mr. Vice President, we reached a turning point today with the CDC, warning schools that they must prepare that they might have to close, members of the Trump administration saying we don't have enough medical masks if necessary. What would you do? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"What we did with Ebola -- I was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the United States, saved millions of lives. And what we did, we set up, I helped set up that office in the presidency, in the president's office, on -- on diseases that are pandemic diseases. We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. We should -- and our president today -- and he's wiped all that out. We did it. We stopped it. And the second thing I'd point out to you is that what I would do immediately is restore the funding. He cut the funding for CDC. He tried to cut the funding for NIH. He cut the funding for the entire effort. And here's the deal. I would be on the phone with China and making it clear, we are going to need to be in your country; you have to be open; you have to be clear; we have to know what's going on; we have to be there with you, and insist on it and insist, insist, insist.

Whether or not the issue is climate change, which is clearly a global crisis requiring international cooperation, or infectious diseases like Coronavirus, requiring international cooperation, we have to work and expand the World Health Organization.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"Thank you, Norah. Mayor Bloomberg, you've said that President Xi Jinping of China is not a dictator and that he is responsive to his constituents, and that the U.S. must cooperate with Beijing. How far does that go? Would you allow Chinese firms to build critical U.S. infrastructure? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"No, I would not. And I think the Chinese government has not been open. Their press -- the freedom of press does not exist there. They -- their human rights record is abominable, and we should make a fuss, which we have been doing, I suppose. But we -- make no mistake about it, we have to deal with China, if we're ever going to solve the climate crisis. We have to deal with them because our economies are inextricably linked. We would be -- not be able to sell or buy the products that we need. And, in terms of whether he's a dictator, he does serve at the behest of the Politboro, of their group of people, but there's no question he has an enormous amount of power. And he -- but he does play to his constituency. You can negotiate with him. That's exactly what we have to do, make it seem that it's in his interest and in his people's interest to do what we want to do, follow the rules, particularly no stealing of intellectual property; follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"No, I would not. And I spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office. This is a guy who is -- doesn't have a democratic, with a small D, bone in his body. This is a guy who is a thug, who in fact has a million Uighurs in ""reconstruction camps,"" meaning concentration camps. This is a guy who you see what's happening right now in -- in Hong Kong, and this is a guy who I was able to convince should join the international agreement at the Paris agreement because, guess what, they need to be involved. You can cooperate and you can also dictate exactly what they are, when in fact they said ""We're going to set up a no-fly zone, that you can't fly through our zone. He said, ""What do you expect me to do,"" when I was over there. I said, ""We're going to fly right through it. We flew B-1 bombers through it. We've got to make it clear.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"Senator Warren, same question. Would you allow Chinese firms to build infrastructure? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"We -- we have to be able to trust our president, because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just can't follow every part of that. And that's one of the reasons that we need to see any candidate's taxes. We know that Mayor Bloomberg has been doing business with China for a long time, and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes. He plans to release them after Super Tuesday. It is not enough to be able to say, just trust me on this. We have a president who said he was going to release his taxes after the election and has refused to do this. "

We probably have another couple of weeks left to go. We're doing it as fast we can. We've complied with every single requirement for disclosure.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"Ten years. I want to say something about foreign policy, which is this, we keep acting as if we're in the 20th Century or the 19th Century. If you look at the biggest threats to the United States, we're talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the United States. We're talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need U.S. leadership for countries around the world. In fact, Mr. Trump's policy of us going it alone, of ""America first,"" of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. The biggest threat to America right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. And it's time for us to deal with it that way. Every single foreign policy issue is about American leadership and coalition. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,New topic. Senator Sanders. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Can I say one word on... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"You praised -- it's in the same theme, sir. You've praised the Chinese Communist Party for lifting more people out of extreme poverty than any other country. You also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and in Nicaragua. Can Americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"I have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg just said a moment ago. He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? Who elects the politburo? You have got a real dictatorship there. Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba. What I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. Yes, I think...[booing] Really? Really? Literacy programs are bad? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Yes, because there's no comparing those two commentaries. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,What Barack Obama said is they made great progress on education and health care. That was Barack Obama. Occasionally... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,I talked to Barack Obama... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Excuse me, occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran. And when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans do something good, you acknowledge that. But you don't have to trade love letters with them. [crosstalk] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,Mr. Vice President. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Barack Obama was abroad, he was in a town meeting, he did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the Cuban government. He acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy. But he went on and condemned the dictatorship. He went on and condemned the people who, in fact, had run that committee. He also made sure to make it clear -- and by the way, I called to make sure that I was prepared to -- I never say [inaudible] my private conversations with him, but the fact of the matter is he, in fact, does not, did not, has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,How about Cuba or Nicaragua?

[applause] [booing] This is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. This is about 2020. We are not going to survive or succeed, and we're certainly not going to win by reliving the Cold War. And we're not going to win these critical, critical House and Senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the Democratic Party is telling people to look at the bright side of the Castro regime.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"I would make them pay for it, and I would make them pay for it economically. They are engaged now, as I speak, in interfering in our elections. They were engaged, and when we -- when, in fact, we were -- the last election in 2016 against Hillary, they were. There's no question. This man stood before the whole world, turned to the Russian leader and said, why in God's name would this man ever interfere in our elections? Give me a break. Seventeen intelligence agencies said he did. When we got the information, we went to the committee in the Senate that's responsible for knowing these issues and dealing with them. We went to Mitch McConnell and said join us and point out what is happening here. He said, no, we want no part of it. And if we had moved -- we didn't have all the information at that time until after the election was over. And, so, the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more, theoretically that's true, but the fact of the matter is we didn't have the information until the end.

We have to oppose a president who sides with a hostile foreign power that commits cyber warfare against the United States of America. That's where we are. Where are all these patriotic Republicans who wave the flag, but when we're actually under attack, they side with our enemies? It's outrageous. [applause] That's why he should have been impeached.

dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BLOOMBERG,"Well, the battle has been going on for a long time in the Middle East, whether it's the Arabs versus the Persians, the Shias versus the Sunnis, the Jews in Israel and the Palestinians, it's only gone on for 40 or 50 years. Number one, you can't move the embassy back. We should not have done it without getting something from the Israeli government. But it was done, and you're going to have to leave it there. Number two, only solution here is a two-state solution. The Palestinians have to be accommodated. The real problem here is you have two groups of people, both who think God gave them the same piece of land. And the answer is to obviously split it up, leave the Israeli borders where they are, try to push them to pull back some of those extra over the -- on the other side of the wall, where they've built these new communities, which they should not have done that, pull it back. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much. Senator Warren? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"Look, the way we have to think about this is I think we have to start with the values and what has to be protected here. Israelis have a right to security and the Palestinians have a right to be treated with dignity and to have self-determination. That is a two-state solution. But it's not up to us to determine what the terms of a two-state solution are. We want to be a good ally to everyone in the region. The best way to do that is to encourage the parties to get to the negotiating table themselves. Donald Trump's big mistake is he keeps putting a thumb on the scale on just one side, and that moves the parties further away from working out their own solution here. We need to be an ally by supporting them to come to negotiate to find a lasting peace. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"But, Senator Warren, just on the question of the embassy, what was your position on that? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,It is not ours to do. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,Would you move it back? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,It is not ours to do. We should let the parties determine the capital. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,"Would you move it back or not, yes or no? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,It's our embassy. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,We should let the parties determine the capitals themselves. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,GARRETT,Norah? O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"I want to turn now to the issue of North Korea, because President Trump has engaged in direct diplomacy, meeting directly with Kim Jong-un. Senator Klobuchar, if you were commander-in-chief, would you meet with the North Korean leader? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"I would, but not in the way this president has done it. He literally thinks he can go over and bring a hot dish to the dictator next door and he thinks everything's going to be fine. He has not done it with our allies. He has literally just hastily called summits and run off. That is no way to do it. And, as you can see, North Korea is emboldened. They're still launching missiles. They've promised a Christmas surprise that thankfully never happened. And he has not been able to advance the ball at all. So what would I do? I would work with our allies. And as has been pointed out, this is what this president fails at all the time. We should be negotiating ourselves back into the Iran nuclear agreement. We should be working with Russia not only to stand up for the protection of our elections and call Vladimir Putin out for what he is, the ruthless dictator that takes down planes, that poisons dissidents, but that, also, at the same time, we have to acknowledge that we should be renegotiating the New START treaty and the other arms negotiations that must happen. This president just likes to do tweets at 4"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Senator Klobuchar, thank you. [applause] Mr. Vice President, how would you deal with North Korea? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"You don't negotiate with a dictator, give him legitimacy without any notion whether he is going to do anything at all. You don't do that. Look what happened. He gave this dictator -- he's a thug -- legitimacy. We've weakened the sanctions around the world against holding us -- committing people not to trade, if anything from oil to parts -- that can deal with providing missile technology. And what's happened? It's been weakened. I would be in Beijing, I would be calling to -- I would be speaking with Xi Jinping. I would be reassigning the relationship between the Japan and South Korea, and I would make it clear, I would make it clear to China, we are going to continue to move closer to make sure that we can, in fact, prevent China -- prevent North Korea from launching missiles to take them down. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,OK. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,And if we don't -- why am I stopping? No one else stops. [applause] O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"OK. OK, sir. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,It's my Catholic school training. [applause] O'
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,OK. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Vice President Biden, you're a gentleman. Good home training. Thank you, sir. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"Yeah, gentlemen don't get very well treated up here. O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,Margaret Brennan? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"Thank you very much, Norah. This is a question for Mayor Buttigieg. As you know, viewers and voters are participating in this through Twitter. The city of Idlib in Syria is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The Syrian regime and Russia are targeting schools, bakeries, and hospitals. What would you do as president to push back regime and Russian forces and stop the killing of innocent civilians? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Well, first of all, I stand with the people of Idlib, who are being targeted, as you said, in a brutal fashion by a dictatorship that has already been so brutal for so many years. And this is one of the reasons we have got to change the balance of power in the region, because the president has basically vanished from the stage when it comes to even playing a role in the future there. Turkey, Russia, Iran all have so much more of a say than we do. We don't have to be invading countries to be making a difference, working with our international partners, in order to deliver peace and support those who are standing up for self-determination. Now, I want to come back to something -- and I promise it relates to international affairs -- because Senator Sanders asked me a question earlier. He asked the question of whether health care for everybody is a radical idea, and it's not, which is why I'm for it, very much in a different way, though. What is a radical idea is completely eliminating all private insurance. And part of how you know it is, is that no industrialized country has gone that far. He and I both like to talk about Denmark, for example. But even in Denmark, they have not abolished the possibility of private insurance. So this is an idea that goes further than what is acceptable in Denmark the country, let alone imagining how that's going to fly in Denmark, South Carolina. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"Thank you, Mayor. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Can I respond? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"Senator Warren, would you like to respond? What would do -- what would Senator Warren do to stop the mass murder? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,I'm sorry? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"What would -- same question. What would you do to stop the mass murder in Idlib, Syria? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"Look, I think that what we've got to do is we have to provide humanitarian relief. We need to work with our allies on this. But this is not a moment for military intervention. We have got to use our military only when we see a military problem that can be solved militarily. We cannot send our military in unless we have a plan to get them out. So, for me, this is about working with our allies. It is about standing with the people who are under enormous pressure right now. This is recognizing what Donald Trump has put us in, in a terrible box around the world. But the solution is not to use our military. The solution is to use the other tools here. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BRENNAN,"Thank you, Senator. Gayle? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"We've talked a lot about your policies during this debate. Now we'd like to get a little more personal. I know, Senator Sanders, how much you enjoy that. We're going to ask you, when we come back from the break, about the words you live by. We're going to give you a couple of minutes to gather your thoughts, and we'll be right back. [applause] O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Welcome back to Charleston, South Carolina. This is the final segment of the final debate before the first in the South primary this Saturday and Super Tuesday one week from today. Gayle? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, one final question, candidates, and it is a two-parter. First, I'd like you each to tell us your -- the biggest misconception about you. That's number one. Number two, the South Carolina motto is this. ""While I breathe, I hope."" So outside of politics, in no more than 45 seconds or so, what is your personal motto, your personal belief, your favorite quote that represents you? Mr. Steyer, the biggest misconception, and then your motto? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,The biggest misconception about me is that somehow I'm defined by business success and money. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"OK, and your motto? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,STEYER,"My motto: Every day, I write a cross on my hand to remind myself to tell the truth and do what's right, no matter what. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right. [applause] Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Senator Klobuchar? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,I'd say the biggest... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,UNKNOWN,[inaudible] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"The biggest misconception is that I'm boring, because I'm not. [laughter] Then, I would say that my motto is the words of one of my political mentors, Paul Wellstone, who sadly is no longer with us. And he said that ""politics is about improving people's lives."" And that's been my life, from when my grandpa was an iron ore miner in the unions. Politics made those mines safer. And when my dad needed treatment, it was there for him, and, in his words, he was ""pursued by grace."" And when my mom got divorced and she didn't have a job and she went back to teaching and that gift of public service got her through. And then when our daughter was born and she couldn't swallow... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Senator Klobuchar, what was your motto? I'm sorry. Senator Klobuchar, what was your motto? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,"Oh, I thought we had a minute to answer the question. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"No, what was your motto? I'm sorry. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,My motto was that politics is about improving people's lives. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Got it. Got it. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,Yes. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Vice President Biden, biggest misconception? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,It was a pretty good one? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,It was a very good one -- very good one. [laughter] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KLOBUCHAR,Thank you. Thank you. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"When you get knocked down, get up. And everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity, no matter what, no matter who they are. My -- also, that everyone should be represented. Everyone -- and no one's better than me and I'm no better than anyone else. The fact is, what we should be doing -- we talked about the Supreme Court. I'm looking forward to making sure there's a black woman on the Supreme Court, to make sure we in fact get every representation. [applause] Not a joke -- not a joke. I pushed very hard for that. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Vice President... 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,"And my mother's motto was -- she said, ""You know, you're defined by your courage; you're redeemed by your loyalty."" I am loyal. I do what I say. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"What's the biggest misconception about you, sir? "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BIDEN,I have more hair than I think I do. [laughter] 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,There's a way to fix that. Senator Sanders? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,Misconception? 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,Yes. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,"Misconception -- and you're hearing it here tonight, is that the ideas I'm talking about are radical. They're not. In one form or another, they exist in countries all over the world. Health care is a human right. We have the necessity, the moral imperative, to address the existential threat of climate change. Other countries are doing that. We don't need more people in jail, disproportionately African-American, than any other country on earth -- not a radical idea. The motto, the saying that -- that moves me the most is from Nelson Mandela. And Mandela said, ""Everything is impossible until it happens."" [applause] And that means, if we have the guts to stand up to powerful special interests who are doing phenomenally well; if we can bring working people together, black and white and Latino, we can create a nation... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"All right, Senator... "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,SANDERS,... where all people have a good standard of living. 
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,KING,"Senator, thanks you, sir. Senator Warren? [applause] "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,WARREN,"Well, I suppose one misconception is that I don't eat very much. In fact, I eat all the time. [laughter] Because I get teased about this. Look, I never was supposed to be on a stage like this. And the misconception is that I thought I should be president of the United States? No. I got into this because I am a fighter. My motto ties in directly to this. It's Mathew 25, and that is, ""Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these, the least of thy brethren, ye have done it unto me."" For me this is about how we treat other people and how we lift them up. That is why I am in this fight. That is why I am running to be president, and it is why I will be an effective president. [applause] O'"
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,DONNELL,"Thank you, Senator. Now Buttigieg. "
dem_primary_debate_2_25_20,BUTTIGIEG,"Well, I think the biggest conception -- misconception is that I'm not passionate. I get that I'm kind of level, some say unflappable. I don't think you want a president who is flappable. But it's precisely because I'm so passionate about the things that are going on in this country. That I consider it important to approach all of that with discipline. And my disciplines are guided by the mottoes I try to live by, many of which come from scripture. And just to be clear, I would never impose my interpretation of my religion to anybody. Just as sure as I'm wearing this ring I'll never let that happen to anybody. But I seek to live by the teachings that say if you would be a leader, you must first be a servant. And, of course, the teaching, not unique to the Christian tradition, but a big part of it, that holds that we are to treat others as we would be treated. And when I think about everything at stake, from racial and economic justice to our stewardship of the climate, to the need to heal the sick and the need to heal this country, I seek for those teachings to order my steps as I go through this campaign and as I go through life. [applause] O'"
